# AmericanCorrespondence

This is a repository of published, public domain primary sources related to early American history, along with some initial text analysis experiments. This project has recently received support through UCLA's Digital Humanities Research Accelerator program. By the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, a revised repository will be uploaded, and initial findings will be shared here.
