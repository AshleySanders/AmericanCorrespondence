INDIAN SPEECH. 

St Joseph's 19th Septr 1786 

The undermentioned chiefs assembled and requested I would inform You what they had to say. 

The Cornstalk said to his Father at Michilimakinac, that he would look up the Road and hinder the Americans to take possession of their Lands. 

His father told them that was right, & not to let any pass, except the English and French Traders.

Now the Americans are advancing, and assembling at the entrance of the Whole Rivers in great numbers; we received this intelligence by two Kickapoo messengers who arrived yesterday; they say the Americans are to come by three different Roads, first Vincennes, Eel River & Miamis; its one Mr. Le Gras wrote to the Kickapoos and told them the Americans were coming according to their promise. Their Father at Michilimackinac told them, take care of your Traders and protect them.

This day I acquaint you, that they are advancing near to us, we expect you'll assist us, as likewise expect you will inform our Father at Michilimackinac, of his former promise to us, we expect a favorable answer from you, which will assist to cover us from the menaces of our Enemy.

It is not the first time we stop'd them from coming that Road, as the same with all the Force we have if they come that way again. We inform you of the contents of this Message and salute you.

Who bring you this speech 

I am Sir, Your very obedient and humble Servant
