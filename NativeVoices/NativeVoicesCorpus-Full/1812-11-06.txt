The Americans have long threatened to strike us, and in the beginning of the summer they declared war against us, and lately they commenced Hostilities by invading the Country at Queenstown in this contest which with the help of God terminated in our favor your much lamented commander General Brock, his aid de camp Colonel McDonell and several warriors have fallen. Brother. We therefore now seeing you darkened with grief your eyes dim with tears, and your throat stopped with the force of your affliction. With these strings of wampum we wipe away your tears, that you may view clearly the surrounding objects, we clear the passage in your throats that you may have free utterance for your thoughts, and we wipe clear from Blood the place of your abode, that you may sit there in comfort without having renewed the remembrance of your loss by the remaining stains of Blood. 8 strings white wampum. Brother. That the remains of your late beloved friend & Commander General Brock shall receive no injury we cover it with this Belt of Wampum, which we do from the grateful sensations which his friendship towards us continually inspired us with, as also in conformity to the customs of our ancestors & we therefore now express with the unanimous voice of the Chiefs & warriors of our respective Bands the great respect in which we hold his memory & the sorrow & deep regret with which his loss has filled our hearts. Although he has taken his departure for a better abode, where his many virtues will be rewarded by the Great Dispenser of good who has led us on the Road to Victory. A large white Belt.
