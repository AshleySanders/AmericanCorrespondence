speaks on three strings. 

Father! I must remind you of your promises, at the time you first engaged 
us to espouse the King's cause you told us that not only the wants of the 
Warriours but those of our families should be supplied in great profusion. 

Delivers three Strings 

Father! We have received a message last summer, through you, from, 
the Commander in Chief, forbidding us to treat our Prisoners with cruelty, 
assuring us that it was contrary to the laws" of God and custom of 
nations which speech I have accepted and shall preserve. You will however 
recollect that we have injuries to revenge and altho' you protect the Enemy 
from the stake, you shall not from their Death, for the Warriours are determined not to spare them in battle, therefore Father be not surprised at seeing in future more Scalps than Prisoners- 
Father! After having remind you of your promises and done your will I 
must inform you, that we and the other nations were much surprised to see 
people return from you to our Village unprovided, owing to the want of where- 
with to supply them, as you told them you had not the things which they 
wanted. I beg of you Father not to use the same discourse to us, that you 
want certain things, but that you will provide not only for those who have 
accompanied me hither, but for those also who we have left behind to guard 
our village. 

Father! I, and my people expect that you will give us necessaries in abundance, as also, such ornaments which is acceptable and pleasing to young 
men, if otherwise we shall imagine, you do not speak from the Heart. 

Father! You cannot be ignorant that we are always engaged with an 
Enemy, or, on the watch at our Villages 

he then speaks on two Strings 
Father ! You may recollect that the last time I was here, I lost a Prisoner, which you promised to see returned as he was adopted among us, I am therefore surprised that you have not yet satisfied me on that subject, as it does 
not correspond with your promise, I find by experience from my knowledge 
of mankind that from the late alteration you only speak from the mouth. 

Father ! I pray of you to consider that my loss is great with respect to the 
prisoner, if ever you have been in my situation judge from your feelings if I 
have not reason to regret his loss 

Father ! Before I finish my discourse I must repeat to you again to us & 
our "Warriours well, in supplying them with such things as they require, if 
not, what effect will my advice have upon them to enforce what you may 
direct 

Father ! You ordered two Barrels of Powder to be given out to us at St. 
Dooskey of which we have received but a "small part, we therefore hope that 
you will order it to be delivered to us at present exclusive of our proportion 
which we are to have 

Major De Peyster then answered 
Children of the Six Nations who Inhabit the Shawanese Country. 

Listen to the answer which I shall make to your speech When the Governor of this Place first engaged you to take the part of your English Father 
he looked upon it as best for your mutual interest, on my arrival here I saw 
the necessity of your continuing to act on the side you where engaged, with- 
out which you must have been overpowered before now you cannot deny 
but that I have ever fulfilled his promises as far as circumstances would 
admit You that have so great a knowledge of humankind must also be 
capable to make allowances for accidents the ship which was loaded with 
the Goods for Indian presents was taken at sea and as often re-taken by us,- 
she at length arrived at Quebec but it was so late in the year, that the goods 
could not get up the country in time they are arrived at Niagara and I look 
for them every day, as soon as I get them you may expect to receive a pro- 
portion of such articles as the Commander in Chief has thought proper to 
send for his Indian Children but should you grow impatient before the things 
reach me and wish to go home, you must be content with such things only 
as I have to give you with respect to the two Barrels of Gun Powder which 
you desire to have over and above, I must observe to you that I do not mean 
the Powder as a reward for your services but to enable you to defend your 
selves against the Enemy and to hunt, the time which that Powder should 
have been expended is past, since which 1 have repeatedly send powder in 
great quantites and make no doubt but that you have received your share 
thereof 

Children I Consider that we are to act for our mutual interest, if you push me beyond my abilities we shall both fall if you find yourselves disappointed 
in not receiving your necessaries immediately depend upon it I am more so, 
particularly so, from the recommendation Captain Caldwell has given me of 
your conduct in the last Campaign 

Children! With regard to the message which I forwarded to you, desiring 
you to treat all Prisoners with humanity, you must recollect that it's a language I have upon all occasions held out to you, and let me repeat that it is 
greatly your Interest to do so. If Captain Pipe had not put that Colonel to 
death after he had made him Prisoner, the Enemy would not have made an 
attack upon the Indian Country this year, for from every Intelligence which 
I receive they intimate it was only to revenge his Death. 

Children! I have another Message from the Commander in Chief to you 
which is "that you will not push the War into the Enemies Country but 
defend your own, in which he is ready to give you every assistance in his power 

(Delivers several Strings) 

Children! You tell me that I only speak from my mouth and not from the 
heart as I did not return the adopted Prisoner agreeable to promise believe 
me Child'n that I speak so much from the heart that I remember well what I 
said to you, which was "if I could find the Prisoner that I should return him 
to you, I repeat the same to you still and I have so much feeling that I shall 
provide for the person to whom he was related. 

I have nothing more to say, but to desire Mr Baby to treat you as well as 
he can at present with such things as is in store
