We ask you all to join us in this undertaking. it is of interest to us all. this is the most dangerous place which we have in this part. My brother, you know the men of the Wabash as we do. you will find, properly, that we have no faith in them, and that we take precautions on our passage having a party of whites and a few of all the nations who are near, the number increases every day. On the contrary if they leave this post in peace the number of his children will diminish, for we think and flatter ourselves that we will not abandon you. This is the best time to ensure a great peace. My father, we extend the hand and pray thee to let us know your sentiments on this subject we take measures to make the canoes of elm. This is the true time to make all peaceable.
