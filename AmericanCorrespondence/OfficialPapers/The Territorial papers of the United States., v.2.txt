LAND ORDINANCE OF 1785  [May 20, 1785) An Ordinance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of Lands in the Western territory " Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled That the territory ceded by individual States to the United States which has been purchased of the Indian inhabitants shall be disposed of in the following manner A Surveyor from each State shall be appointed by Congress or a committee of the States, who shall take an oath for the faithful discharge of his duty before the Geographer of the United States, who is hereby empowered and directed to administer the same; and the like oath shall be administered to each chain carrier by the surveyor under whom he acts. The Geographer, under whose direction the surveyors shall act, shall occasionally form such regulations for their conduct, as he shall deem necessary; and shall have authority to suspend them for misconduct in Office and shall make report of the same to Congress or to the Committee of the States, and he shall make report in case of sickness, death or resignation of any surveyor. The Surveyors as they are respectively qualified shall proceed to divide the said territory into townships of six miles square, by lines running due north and south and others crossing these at right angles as near as may be, unless where the boundaries of the late Indian purchases may render the same impracticable, and then they shall depart from this rule no farther than such particular circumstances may require; and each surveyor shall be allowed and paid at the rate of two dollars for every mile in length he shall run, including the wages of chain carriers, markers and every other expence attending the same. The first line running north and south as aforesaid shall begin on the river Ohio at a point that shall be found to be due north from the western termination of a line which has been run as the southern boundary of the state of Pennsylvania and the first line running east and west shall begin at the same point and shall extend throughout the whole territory Provided that nothing herein shall be construed as fixing the western boundary of the State of Pensylvania. The geographer shall designate the townships or fractional parts of townships by numbers progressively from south to North, always beginning each range with number one; and the ranges shall be distinguished by their progressive numbers to the westward. The first range extending from the Ohio to the lake Erie being marked number one. The Geographer shall personally attend to the running of the first east and west line and shall take the latitude of the extremes of the first north and south line and of the mouths of the principal rivers.” The lines shall be measured with a chain; shall be plainly marked by chaps on the trees and exactly described on a plat, whereon shall be noted by the Surveyor, at their proper distances, all mines, salt springs, salt licks and mill seats, that shall come to his knowledge, and all water courses mountains and other remarkable and permanent things over or near which such lines shall pass and also the quality of the lands. The plats of the townships respectively shall be marked by subdivisions into lots of one mile square or 640 acres, in the same direction as the external lines and numbered from 1 to 36, always beginning the succeeding range of the lots with the number next to that with which the preceding one concluded. And where, from the causes before mentioned, only a fractional part of a township shall be surveyed, the lots protracted thereon shall bear the same numbers as if the township had been entire. And the surveyors in running the external lines of the townships shall at the interval of every mile mark corners for the lots which are adjacent, always designating the same in a different manner from those of the townships * The geographer and surveyors shall pay the utmost attention to the variation of the magnetic needle, and shall run and note all lines by the true meridian, certifying with every plat what was the variation at the times of running the lines thereon noted. As soon as seven ranges of townships & fractional parts of townships in the direction from south to north shall have been surveyed, the geographer shall transmit plats thereof to the board of treasury, who shall record the same with the report in well bound books to be kept for that purpose: And the geographer shall make similar returns from time to time of every seven ranges as they may be surveyed. The secretary at war shall have recourse thereto, and shall take by lot therefrom a number of townships & fractional parts of townships as well from those to be sold entire as from those to be sold in lots as will be equal to one seventh part of the whole of such seven ranges as nearly as may be, for the use of the late continental army; and he shall make a similar draught from time to time until a sufficient quantity is drawn to satisfy the same, to be applied in manner herein after directed. [The board of treasury shall from time to time cause the remaining numbers, as well those to be sold entire as those to be sold in lots, to be drawn for in the name of the thirteen states respectively according to the quotas in the last preceding requisition on all the states; provided that in Case more land than its proportion is alloted for sale in any state at any distribution, a deduction be made therefor at the next"] The board of treasury shall transmit a copy of the original plats previously noting thereon the townships & fractional parts of townships, which shall have fallen to the several states by the distribution aforesaid to the Commissioners of the loan office of the several states, who after giving notice of not less than two nor more than six months by causing advertisements to be posted up at the court houses or other noted places in every county and to be inserted in one newspaper published in the states of their residence respectively shall proceed to sell the townships or fractional parts of townships at public vendue,” in the following manner, viz. The township or fractional part of a township N 1. in the first range shall be sold entire, and N. 2 in the same range by lots, and thus in alternate order through the whole of the first range. The township or fractional part of a township N 1. in the second range shall be sold by lots, and N. 2 in the same range entire, and so in alternate order through the whole of the second range; and the third range shall be sold in the same manner as the first and the fourth in the same manner as the second and thus alternately throughout all the ranges; provided that none of the lands within the said territory be sold under the price of one dollar the acre to be paid in specie or loan office certificates reduced to specie value by the scale of depreciation or certificates of liquidated debts of the United States including interest, besides the expence of the survey and other charges thereon, which are hereby rated at thirty six dollars the township in specie or certificates as aforesaid, and so in the same proportion for a fractional part of a township or of a lot, to be paid at the time of sales, on failure of which payment the said lands shall again be offered for sale. There shall be reserved for the United States out of every township the four lots being numbered, 8.11. 26.29 and out of every fractional part of a township so many lots of the same numbers as shall be found thereon for future sale: There shall be reserved the lot N 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools within the said township; also one third part of all gold, silver, lead and copper mines, to be sold or otherwise disposed of as Congress shall hereafter direct.” When any township or fractional part of a township shall have been sold as aforesaid and the money or certificates received therefor, the loan officer shall deliver a deed in the following terms.

REPORT OF BOARD OF TREASURY ON WESTERN LAND SALES  - [April 4, 1787] The Board of Treasury" to whom it was referred to Report a Plan for Selling for Public Securities, the Townships Surveyed in the Western Territory.— Beg leave to Observe, That agreeably to the Ordinance of the 20" May 1785,” no Distribution or Sale of Lands can be made until seven Ranges shall have been completely Surveyed, and a Return made of the Surveys. That the Geographer of the United States has lodged with the Board of Treasury, Surveys and Plats of Four Ranges of Townships, and fractional parts of Townships."— That the Surveys of the said four Ranges, do not extend half thro' the same from South to North. That the Townships, and fractional parts of Townships already Surveyed, are twenty six, amounting by a Calculation of the Geographer to 675,000 Acres.— That one seventh part is allotted to the late Army, which is 96,428 Acres, leaving 578,572 Acres to be disposed of by the United States.— That by the Ordinance aforesaid, the Board of Treasury are to have the original Surveys and Plats entered in a Book to be kept for that purpose, and also to send Copies of the same to the several Loan Officers; which with that to be entered in the Book to be kept by the Board, will make fourteen Copies of the same Surveys and Plats, which will create more expence and delay than is probably expedient in the present state of the Public Affairs. That considering the Surveyors have already been employed two Years, it is not probable that in the course of another, they will have completely Surveyed the first seven Ranges. From the foregoing considerations it has become expedient, in the Opinion of the Board, so far to alter the Ordinance, (as to the Lands already Surveyed) as it respects to their distribution to the several States; the Sale of the same by the Commissioners of the Loan Offices, and the Inhibition of any Sale 'till seven Ranges are compleatly Surveyed. For this purpose they submit to the consideration of Congress, the following Resolves— That after the Secretary at War shall have drawn for the proportionate quantity of the Lands already Surveyed, which were assigned to the late Army, agreeably to the Ordinance of the 20" May 1785, the remainder shall be Advertised for Sale in one of the News Papers at least, of each of the States, for the space of four Months from the date of the Advertisement, at the expiration of which time, the Sale of the Land shall commence in the place where Congress shall sit, and continue from day to day until the same shall be disposed of; provided that none of the Land shall be Sold at a less price than One Dollar per Acre, and that the Sale shall be made agreeably to the mode pointed out by the Ordinance aforesaid. That one third of the Purchase Money shall be immediately paid in any of the Public Securities of the United States to the Treasurer of the said States; and that the remaining two thirds shall be paid in like manner in three Months after the date of the Sale, on which payment (a Certificate thereof being previously furnished by the Treasurer to the Board of Treasury) Titles to the Lands shall be given to the Purchasers by the Board of Treasury, agreeably to the Terms prescribed by the said Ordinance; Provided, that if the second payments shall not be made in three Months as aforesaid, the first payment shall be forfeited, and the Land shall again be exposed to Sale. Ordered, That the Board of Treasury take the necessary Measures for carrying the aforesaid Resolutions into effect, and also for exhibiting the Surveys of the Lands.

THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS  WAR OFFICE April 16th 1787 SIR I have the honor to inform Congress that I have received a letter from Colonel Harmar dated the 18th March " at Fort Pitt. He was then on a tour visiting the posts under his command, and was about going down the Ohio to the post at the rapids, from which, he expected to return to the Muskinghum, about the middle of May— He says “that he has had some conferences with General Butler, and from all accounts, matters seem to bear a more favorable aspect with the savages than they hitherto have done” He has also transmitted the enclosed extract of a letter from Major Wyllys who is stationed at the Rapids of the Ohio. The usurpation of the public lands by a body of armed men highly deserves the attention of Congress?" If such audacious defiance of the power of the United States be suffered with impunity a precedent will be established, to wrest all the immense property of the western territory out of the hands of the public. I have the honor to be With the highest respect Your Excellencys Most obedient Servant H KNOX HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.  Letter 16 April 1787 Secy at War Read 18.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY AT WAR RELATIVE TO INTRUDERS ON PUBLIC LANDS  [April 19, 1787] The Secretary of the United States for the department of war to whom was referred his letter to Congress of the 16 of April "transmitting an extract from Major Wyllys's letter to Lieutenant Colonel Harmar dated Rapids of the Ohio 6* February 1787 resulting from a wise administration of the western territory, by the evils of usurpation and intrusion, than by any other causes whatever. That the value of the object—The spirit of adventure—and the supposed imbecillity of government, render the dangers of usurpation on a large scale extremely imminent That if the disposition, to seize the public lands be not curbed in the first instance, in a manner demonstrative of the fixed purpose of government all future attempts to remove intruders may be abortive. Their numbers may be so great as to defy the power of the United States. Or a reluctance in the supreme authority to inflict the calamities, necessarily attendant on an abrupt and forcible removal, of men women and children from their possessions, may prevent the measure. Your Secretary therefore is of opinion, that no intrusions or usurpations ought to be suffered, which the troops stationed on the Ohio are capable of preventing or removing—and that the commanding officer should be directed, to take the most efficient and immediate measures for dispossessing the party of men reported by Major Wyllys to have established themselves at Sº Vincents.” On this principle the following resolve is submitted. Resolved, That the Secretary at War direct the commanding officer of the troops of the United States on the Ohio to take immediate and efficient measures for dispossessing a body of men who have in a lawless and unauthorized manner taken possession of Post Sº Vincent in defiance of the proclamations and authority of the United States, and that he employ the, whole or such part of the force under his command as he shall judge necessary to effect the object.

THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS , WAR OFFICE, April 26th 1787. SIR. The incessant enquiries respecting the lands due to the late army, and a conviction of the perfect dispositions of the United States in Congress assembled, to render ample justice to their late military servants, are the reasons, and I hope will be my apology, for my present address. It is unnecessary to mention the manner in which the arrearages of pay due the late army was settled, or the present state of those arrearages. It is sufficient to observe, that the army were convinced, that had Congress possessed the ability, the payments would have been complete. Too many have been compelled, by their necessities, to sell the evidences of their public debt, for a small proportion of the nominal sum. These unfortunate men now consider the lands promised them, as their only resource against poverty, in old age, and therefore are extremely solicitous to receive, immediately, their dues in this respect.—Uninformed of, or not comprehending the cause which prevent a delivery, they pine and murmur at a four years delay. It is presumed the quantity of land due the army will not be much less than three millions of acres. Their proportion of the quantity already surveyed, may amount to about 100,000 acres. Assuming the surveys of the last year, as a data, or even supposing double the quantity will be surveyed annually in future, yet a very long period must elapse before the whole quantity due will be delivered. A period, at which very few of those entitled to the land will be living. The present object of this letter is to respectfully submit to Congress, the consideration of the propriety of assigning a part of land, bounded on the Ohio, and by some rivers which empty into the same, sufficiently extensive to satisfy the claims of the late army, and to direct some effectual mode free of expence by which individuals may receive their right. In any plan for the disposal of the western territory, if a tract for the army be not assigned, they will be prevented from the benefits intended by Congress. Circumstanced as they are generally, they cannot enter into competition with rich speculators; which in some degree must be the case, if they shall not have a particular tract assigned to them, and surveyed in the most regular manner.” I have the honor to be sir, with the most perfect respect, Your Excellencys Most Obedient Servant H KNOX HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS  Letter 26 April 1787 Secy at War Read 26.th May Referred to Mr Carrington Mº King Mº Dane Mº Madison Mº Benson Acted on Octº 22d 178777–

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO CONGRESS [July 10, 1787] The Secretary of the United States for the department of war to whom was referr'd sundry papers and letters respecting the hostilities on the frontiers of Virginia Reports That the frontiers of Virginia bordering on the Ohio have been in the course of the present year and probably still are involved in the greatest distress, by parties of hostile indians who plunder and murder the inhabitants That the facts are authenticated by the letters and papers transmitted by the Executive of Virginia * the letter of John Cleve Symmes Esq’,” and the letter of the commanding officer of the troops,” all of which accompany this report That from the representations contained in the aforesaid letters and other information prior thereto, it appears most probable that the depredations have been committed by the Shawanoese and the Wabash indians. That the measures necessary to put a stop to said enormities and effectually to prevent them in future demand the most serious attention of the United States.— But your Secretary apprehends that the deep rooted prejudices, and malignity of heart, and conduct, reciprocally entertained and practised on all occasions by the Whites and Savages will ever prevent their being good neighbours. The one side anxiously defend their lands which the other avariciously claim. With minds previously inflamed the slighest offence occasions death—revenge follows which knows no bounds. The flames of a merciless war are thus lighted up which involve the innocent and helpless with the guilty. Either one or the other party must remove to a greater distance, or Government must keep them both in awe by a strong hand, and compel them to be moderate and just. The right that each party assumes of being judges and prompt executioners in their own cause prevents all effectual interference, excepting by a legal coercive power, which shall make the necessary sacrifices to Justice, let them belong to which side they may. But the small corps of troops on the Ohio would feebly support such a system, even were it not to interfere in its execution with the State governments. The number of the troops are about five hundred. These are employed in garrisons and in the field to prevent intrusions on the public lands; to cover the surveyors and to protect the inhabitants of the frontiers. One third of the force is employed directly for the latter object. For which purpose one company is stationed at Venango, part of a company at Fort McIntosh and two companies at the falls of the Ohio. But besides these detachments, the troops protecting the surveyors, and preventing usurpations, have the effect, to cover a very large district of country south of the Ohio, from the depredations of the Savages.— But as the surveys appear to be nearly suspended; and as it is probable that Congress may sell the country in a body from the seven ranges already surveyed to the river Scioto; the disposition of the troops may with propriety be changed, so as more immediately, to conform to the protection of the inhabitants. In the opinion of your Secretary the complete protection of the frontiers, and the other objects of the United States in the western territory, would require a body of fifteen hundred men.—For the want thereof, the public designs and interests languish—The Subjects of Spain have been plundered—And the whole western territory, is liable to be wrested out of the hands of the Union, by lawless adventurers, or by the savages whose imperfect perceptions render them unable to distinguish between the aforesaid description of persons, and the regular authority of the United States Were it practicable to raise and maintain such a body of troops, a chain of posts might be establish[d], which at once would awe the savages, cover the surveyors and prevent intrusions—The Chain to commence with a small garrison at Fort Pitt—to be connected by others established at Le Boeuf at the head of French Creek—thence a portage of twelve miles over to Presqu' Isle on Lake Erie—at Presqu' Isle—at Cayahoga or the mouth of Sandusky Lake whichever on examination should be found to be best calculated to secure boats and shipping—at the mouth of the Miami emptying into Lake Erie— The Miami Village, at the head of the River, a strong post of two hundred and fifty or three hundred men—The head of the Wabash— Post Sº Vincents on the Wabash—The mouth of the Wabash—The mouth of the Ohio–This post would serve as well to curb the professed designs of the lawless, against our Spanish allies, as to evince to the world the dispositions and power of the United States to govern and control their own citizens—The chain would be continued from the mouth of the Ohio to Fort Pitt by small garrisons, at proper intervals, in order to prevent intrusions on the public lands wBut however dignified and important to the character and interests of the United States such a body of troops might be, it is to be regretted that the depressed state of the finances will not admit of the measure—It remains only therefore, that the troops actually in service on the Ohio, be so posted and ordered, as best to restrain the incursions of the savages and prevent usurpations of the public lands. Your Secretary submits the following general disposition of the troops, giving however at all times full permission to the commanding officer, to make such changes, and alterations therein, as he shall judge the good of the service may require. The tribes of indians who inhabit the south western and eastern parts of Lake Erie, seem peaceably inclined. The Shawanoes who were expelled from the Scioto last autumn, have removd to White Creek on the Wabash, and join'd the Wabash indians in their hostilities on the inhabitants of Kentucky—The greater part of the troops should therefore be advanced further down the Ohio–Small garrisons to be retained at Venango Fort Pitt and Fort M*Intosh—One company at Muskinghum part of which to be posted high up on the river— One company high up the Miami and a small post at its mouth— Three companies to be establish'd at Sº Vincents on the Wabash– The remaining troops amounting to two companies and upwards to be stationed at the post already established at the rapids in order as well to cover the settlements, as to afford succour to any post that may want it. A strong post being established at Sº Vincents will probably either curb the hostile indians, or induce them to remove to a greater distance, or incline them to peace. In addition to this arrangement it will be necessary that a treaty be held at Sº Vincents with Shawanoes and other Wabash indians in order to effect a peace—This business would particularly belong to the superintendant—But as the misfortune of breaking his leg will probably incapacitate him for the present,” if so, the business might with propriety be delegated to the commanding officer of the troops—That he should be empowered to make peace with the said indians on the terms prescribed to him by Congress—That he should also be empowered to maintain the said peace as far as the authority or interests of the United States should be concerned—That for this purpose he should have the power to confine and try all persons who should within the jurisdiction and territory of the United States injure or kill any of the indians or otherwise infract the treaty That such presents as Congress shall direct for the treaty be provided by the board of treasury— That if after proper efforts a peace with the indians could not be obtained by reason of their wicked and blood thirsty dispositions the commanding officer should endevor by force to expel them from their towns or extirpate them. That for this purpose he should collect the whole of his force excepting small garrisons for the respective posts.--That he should have power to call upon the district of Kentucky and the frontier counties of Pennsylvania for a sufficient force for such time as would be necessary to effect his object. provided that the force so required should not exceed one thousand men from the counties of Virginia and five hundred from those of Pennsylvania. That the commanding officer of the troops of the United States should have the sole direction and command of the expedition. And that the expences thereof should be borne by the Union— That the Board of Treasury should concur with the Secretary at War in providing the rations, means of transportation and other supplies which should be necessary for such an expedition That the pay of the militia so called into service should be the same as the pay of the regular troops That the States of Virginia and Pennsylvania should pay their respective militia and that the same should be allowed to the said states out of the requisitions of [blank] provided however that no charge for pay rolls for said service be valid unless the said pay rolls be corroberated and supported by actual musters of said militia made by the inspector or by a field officer of the troops of the United States agreeably to the orders of the commanding officer In the present embarrassed state of public affairs and entire deficiency of funds an indian war of any considerable extent and duration would most exceedingly distress the United States—The great distance by land which the stores and supplies must be transported would render the expences intolerable If in the event it should be found necessary to commence with an attack on the Wabash indians it will be very difficult if not impracticable to prevent the other tribes from joining them. The Officers or traders at the British posts would use every art and intrigue for that purpose The expedients herein proposed of posting the troops so as to awe the savages and endevoring by treaties and presents to incline them to peace are the most rational that can be devised by your Secretary An attempt to treat appears to be indispensible even if a war should be the result as at present the disputes between the indians and whites seem to be involved in such a reciprocity of injuries and murders that it may be difficult for the public to judge impartially which is in the wrong—It will be necessary to examine before we strike—Whenever the United States declare war it is to be hoped that it will be a war founded on the immutable principles of Justice All which is humbly submitted H KNOX WAR OFFICE July 10. 1787  10 July 1787 Report of Secy at War touching Indian hostilities Entº Read 11 July 1787 Order of the day for 15"— July 18. 1787 Referred to M' Dane Hawkins Mr Smith Mº Kean Mr Carrington *

Another explanation has been suggested to the effect that the Ohio Company, whose proposal for a grant of land was then pending, desired protection against any law that would interfere with the pyramid of contracts which the company was proposing to erect in order to dispose of its large estate. find necessary for securing the title in such soil to the bonā fide purchasers.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE: INDIAN RELATIONS  [July 26, 1787] The Committee consisting of [blank] to whom was referred a Clause in a report of a Committee,” relative to making provision for preventing wanton and unjust attacks upon the Indians—report—that on carefully examining the subject referred to their consideration, they are fully convinced, that some early and effectual measures must be adopted by Congress, and the several States, whose frontiers are contiguous to the Indians, to prevent the further progress of the mutual depredations & hostilities between the Indians and some of the frontiers Inhabitants of those States—the committee are fully of opinion, that unless a Stop be put to those mutual Injuries, they must soon produce a strong confederacy of the Indians on the frontiers, and all the calamities of a general Indian war—& expose to the merciless revenge of the savages, not only the few guilty, but all the innocent Inhabitants of the frontier Settlements—that the murders and evils complained of, are the result of repeated aggressions, as well on the part of some of the frontier Inhabitants as on the part of the Wabash and several other tribes—that mutual Injuries and apprehensions have produced so great and deep rooted animosities that no peace or cessation of hostilities can, reasonably, be expected to subsist between the parties, while an opportunity remains to lawless persons to attack the Indians with impunity—but as there is, at present, no system of civil law established in the territory of the United States North west of the river Ohio, whereby the conduct of individuals can be controuled, or their offences or Crimes prevented or punished therein, the committee conceive, that, however it ought, in general, to be an object with Governments to try and punish offenders, not in military service, according to the Course of the civil laws of the land, yet, until such laws can be established in that territory, it is highly expedient, in the present State of things there, to try and punish offenders, who shall make unauthorised attacks upon the Indians, by such laws as can be carried into effect and with such dicision as to Stop the further progress of the lawless proceedings of individuals towards the Indians— Wherefore the Committee submit the following resolves— Resolved that no person, not an inhabitant of, or an officer or soldier Stationed in, the territory of the United States North west of the river Ohio, shall, after the first day of September next, and until the first day of September 1788, be allowed to pass through any part of the said territory, without a permit, Signed by the Secretary at war, the Superintendant of Indian affairs in the Northern Department the commander of the federal troops or commander of a separate post the geographer of the United States, or by some other officer named for that purpose, by the Secretary at war; and any such person found in any part of the said territory, during the period aforesaid without such perment or not licensed to be among the indians according to the ordinance for regulating Indian affairs passed August the 7" 1786,” shall be arrested by the officers commanding the federal troops, confined not exceeding 8 days, and sent to the frontiers of one of the States and for a second or third offence shall be liable to be Whipped not exceeding forty Stripes “– and if any person in the said territory not otherwise liable to be punished for his or her offences shall kill, wound, assault or beat any Indian; destroy, secretly, or forceably, take away his or her property without lawful authority such person shall be arrested, confined, tried and punished in the same manner as the soldiers in the actual Service of the United States in the said territory, may be arrested confined, tried and punished for like offences—and this law for punishing wrongs done to the Indians shall remain in force until other laws shall be made for trying and punishing the same— Resolved that it be recommended to the States of New York, Penn- Sylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia to pay particular attention to the execution of their respective laws for preventing their Citizens respectively, from wrongfully invading the rights of the Indians, and to the revision of those laws where the same may be inadequate to the purposes of preventing Injuries being done to them when within the limits of the respective States  No 24 Report of Mº Dane M' Grayson Mr Clarke for preventing unjust attacks on the Indians En" read 26 July 1787 * 
PETITION OF THE INHABITANTS OF POST VINCENNES [July 26, 1787] To the Honorable the Congress of the United States of North America. The humble address of the inhabitants of Post Vincennes Sheweth: That your petitioners have, for upwards of sixty years, inhabited this country, where the Indian nations on the Wabash allowed them to live and make settlements: That the kings of England maintained us in our rights and privileges, after the cession made them of this country by the king of France: * That the State of Virginia confirmed the same when they took possession of the post:” That when that State ceded to Congress their lands on the North-western side of the Ohio, they stipulated with your honorable body that the Inhabitants of the Illinois, and Post Vincennes should continue to enjoy the same rights, claims, and privileges which they had always enjoyed.” Your petitioners beg leave to observe, that, previous to their being subjects of the United States, being chiefly addicted to the Indian trade, they, in a great measure, overlooked the advantages that can be derived from the cultivation of lands, and consequently neglected to avail themselves of the willingness of their Sovereigns and Governors to grant them tracts sufficient for plantations. Contented to raise bread for our families, we neither extended our culture for the purpose of exportation, nor formed an idea of dividing among ourselves our fruitful country. The moment we were connected with the United States, we began to be sensible of the real value of lands; and our decreasing peltry trade pointed out to us the necessity of applying ourselves to that new kind of industry. It was then that a grant of a large tract of territory made to us by the Pianguicha “ Indians began to be recollected, and that a number of our neighbours came to partake with us the blessings of a fruitful soil and healthy climate For a number of years we had been neglected, and as it were forsaken by the power to whom we had willingly submitted—The resolves of Congress —the laws of America, respecting land-affairs, were utterly unknown to us. We had a grant from the Indians; we had settled the country; we had possessed it for a long series of years; our charter was as much (or indeed more) talked of among the Americans as among ourselves. . Our confidence rested upon those principles; and fully persuaded in the simplicity of our hearts, that our right to the tract granted to us by the Pianquicha Indians was as clear and indisputable as that of inheritance, we did not scruple to give every adventurer who came to live with us a plantation of four hundred acres; not forgetting, however, to leave those concessions subject to such regulations as might be hereafter made by Congress. As our acquaintance with our neighbours became more extensive, our charter began to appear to ourselves in a different light from what we had heretofore viewed it; and we are afraid it does not rest upon a sufficiently firm basis. We neither expect, nor wish, that a territory of two hundred and ten miles by seventy two should be exclusively appropriated to our small number— Accustomed to mediocrity, we do not wish for wealth, but for a mere competency. Reposing the most unbounded confidence in the justice, humanity and benevolence of the Honorable the Congress we solemnly surrender our charter, whatever it is, and throw ourselves upon your mercy. We have taken an exact account of the number of people now residing in the district of Post-Vincennes, and we humbly hope that the Honorable the Congress may be graciously pleased to grant us, in the vicinity of this place, as much land, for the use and sole benefit of the now inhabitants, as you in your wisdom may think adequate to our just right as ancient settlers, to our past sufferings, and present indigent circumstances. We beg leave to submit to your honorable body, our own expectations which, we hope, you will deem moderate, and grounded upon the principle of exciting among our- Selves a spirit of industry and activity, more than upon a love of extensive property. First. That every male inhabitant of this district, without discrimination of age, be entitled to five hundred acres of land. Second. That as much land as will be equal to the total quantity so granted be moreover conceded to the district as a community to be applied to public uses—such as building Court-houses, Jails, churches, bridges, repairing roads—&c. Upon these principles, and from the annexed calculation of the inhabitants of this district at the present aera,” the total number of acres of land, which your petitioners humbly expect to obtain from the Honorable the Congress, will amount to five hundred and twenty thousand, or thirty miles square, an inconsiderable territory, compared to that granted to us by the indians who, at the time they gave it to us, were thought to be proprietors of the country. If, to principles of common justice, it were necessary to add motives of compassion, we might tell the Honorable the Congress a long tale of uninterrupted distresses, oppressions, and calamities, heaped up upon us with as unremitted and wanton a tyranny as borne by us with unparalled patience. We might tell them that we were once a happy and wealthy people, until we fell a prey to the unquenchable rapacity of those whom we had received as friends; that we, after voluntarily and cheerfully becoming subjects of the State of Virginia were oppressed, plundered, deprived of the common rights of citizens by an army of petty tyrants who assumed powers which neither the legislature nor the Executive of their State had delegated to them. We might tell the Honorable the Congress that our attachment to the cause of America, and active zeal for its welfare, has subjected us to the enmity of those Indians who had, time immemorial, called us their fathers and friends; that we have, in repeated instances, exhausted our remaining substance, to make large presents to the Indians in order to stop their war-parties: That we are become as obnoxious to them as the Americans themselves, and have frequently endangered our lives, because we have refused to deliver up these our friends to their savage fury. These are facts to which all the Americans settled among us can bear witness. With a respectful confidence that the Honorable the Congress will listen to the justice of our humble petition, and look down upon us with an eye of commiseration, your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray for the welfare, honor and glory of the United States of North America.

MANASSAH CUTLER & AND WINTHROP SARGENT & TO THE BOARD OF TREASURY  NEW YORK July 26th 1787 GENTLEMEN, We observe by the Act of the 23" Ins'" that your honorable board is authorised to enter into a Contract for the sale of a tract of land therein described on certain conditions expressed in the Act. As we suppose this measure has been adopted in consequence of proposals made by us, in behalf of ourselves and associates, to a Committee of Congress, we beg leave to inform you that we are ready to enter into a contract for the purchase of the lands described in the Act; provided you can conceive yourselves authorised to admit of the following conditions, which in some degree vary from the report of the Committee Viz'— The subordinateSurveys shall be completed as mentioned in the Act, unless the frequency of Indian irruptions may render the same impracticable without an heavy expence to the Company. The mode of payment we propose is half a million of dollars when the Contract is executed; another half million when the tract as described is surveyed by the proper Officer of the United States; and the remainder in six equal payments computed from the date of the second payment.— The lands assigned for the establishment of a University to be nearly as possible in the Centre of the first million and half of Acres we shall pay for; for to fix it in the Centre of the proposed purchase, might too long defer the establishment.— When the second payment is made the purchasers shall receive a deed for as great a quantity of land as a Million of dollars will pay for, at the price agreed on—After which we will agree not to receive any further deeds for any of the lands purchased, only at such periods, and on such Conditions as may be agreed on betwixt the board and the purchasers.- As to the security which the Act says shall be good and sufficient we are unable to determine what those terms may mean in the contemplation of Congress, or of your honorable board—We shall therefore only observe that our private fortunes, and that of most of our associates being embarked in the support of the purchase it is not possible for us to offer any adequate security, but that of the land itself, as is usual in great land purchases.— We will agree so to regulate the Contract, that we shall never be entitled to a right of entry, or occupancy, but on lands actually paid for, nor receive any deeds till our payments amount to a million of dollars, and then only in proportion to such payment.—The advance we shall always be under without any formal deed together with the improvements made on the lands, will we presume be ample Security, even if it was not the interest as well as the disposition of the Company to lay the foundation of their establishment, on a sacred regard to the rights of property.— If these terms are admitted we shall be ready to conclude the Contract—If not we shall have to regret, for a numerous Class of our Associates, that the Certificates they received as Specie, at the risque of their lives and fortunes, in support of the Common cause, must, for a considerable time longer, wait the tedious and precarious issue of public events; (altho' they are willing to surrender their right in them on terms advantageous to the public;)—and that the United States may lose an opportunity of securing in the most effectual manner, as well as improving the value of their western lands, whilst they establish a powerful barrier, against the irruptions of the Indians, or any attempts of the British power, to interrupt the security of the adjoining States.”— We have the Honor to be, with the greatest respect for ourselves and associates, Gentlemen, Your obedient Humble Servants.- (Signed) MAN" CUTLER WINTHROP SARGENT.- THE HONORABLE THE BOARD OF TREASURY compared with the original in the office of the Board of Treasury (Signed) Win Duer Secy.

ADDRESS TO COLONEL JOSIAH HARMAR [August 4, 1787] Copy of an address of the American Inhabitants at Post Vincennes to Colonel Harmar.— COL: JOS: HARMAR. SIR. Amidst the public testimonies of satisfaction, which display themselves upon every countenance, since peace, harmony, and order have, at your call, revisted this, heretofore, unhappy country, how peculiarly unfortunate must our situation be when an event in which all good men rejoice is, nevertheless, likely to be attended with some discouraging circumstances to us, the american Inhabitans of this post. If we understand your heart, Sir, your own sensations at the sight of a people whom you have rendered happy, pure as their source is, must needs be mixed with some degree of painful recollection, when you consider that you cannot discharge your whole duty without distressing a considerable number of your fellow-creatures. It is from a conviction of this sympathising benevolence of your's, Sir, that we are encouraged to hope that, thro' your mediation, we may yet share in the public joy. You are too well acquainted with the nature of the principle on which we had made settlements within the boundaries of the french charter, not to make it unnecessary for us to dwell on that subject. The proclamation of Congress,” and the orders published by yourself,” have filled our hearts with anxiety, gloominess, and dismay. We cannot, however, give up as yet our faint remains of hope, that Congress will condescend to look favorably upon our respectful petition, which we take the liberty to transmit to you, Sir; and, if you deign to countenance it, we have not the least doubt but that your Powerful protection, concurring with the annexed recommendation of the french inhabitants in our behalf, will have the desired effect. We have the honor to be with respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble servants. 4×g ust 4th 1787.

PETITION TO CONGRESS FROM POST VINCENNES, [August 7, 1787] To the Honorable the Congress of the United-States of North-America The humble Address of the American inhabitants of Poste Vincennes Sheweth That your Petitioners, after a long & severe struggle for liberty, finding themselves, by the necessary contributions to the charges of a just & expensive war, by the declension of trade, and the consequent neglect of husbandry, reduced to poverty & misery, and seeing no prospect of relief at home, went to seek far distant countries where they might expect to raise a subsistance by their industry. Neither the distressing circumstance of leaving behind us the dear connexions of our youth, the country that gave us birth, the fields for which we bled; nor the tediousness of a journey of several months; nor the dangers to which we have been exposed from the elements, from the Indians, from a total want of provisions, were able to deter us from our undertaking. We had heard of a Charter under which the french inhabitants of Poste Vincennes held a considerable territory; we visited them, and found that their lands were such as answered all our wishes. The french chearfully invited us to settle ourselves among them: we purchased some of their ancient settlements, and obtained from their Court of justice warrants & Deeds for further locations within the boundaries of their Charter. Our industry became a spur to their's; from us they learnt the usefulness of husbandry; and, if there be any merit in promoting a love of rural employments, we flatter ourselves we have deserved well of mankind by disseminating the arts beneficial to human societies. We confess that at an early period previous to our arrival in this country, and lately, some unwarrantable proceedings very injurious to the good people here have taken place; but we are happy in the testimony of all the french settlers that not one of your Petitioners, in whose behalf they have wrote to Colonel Harmar, has in any shape been accessary to their sufferings. We had hitherto possessed our lands with all the security that the laws of our country had taught us to repose in the sacredness of a Charter. What must have been our surprise & concern when we lately understood that the rights of the french, a few ancient concessions excepted, had not a more solid foundation than a gift from the Indians, which tho' of an older date than the late glorious Revolution may perhaps be overruled, & which besides the french have offered to give up to Congress! Struck with amazement & consternation, we are at the eve of seeing our distresses renewed, with the additional anguish of deluded hope. A ray of comfort, however, throws yet a glimpse of light through our darkened prospect. We hope every thing from the equity & generosity of the Honorable the Congress; and confiding that they will be graciously pleased to grant to every male American inhabitant of this district, of any age whatever, a tract of five hundred acres of land, or whatever you may think proper, adjoining that of the french settlers, Your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray for the welfare honor & glory of the United- States of North-America.

SIR/ Convinced that the principal object you had in view in visiting this district, was to subsitute order in the place of anarchy and confusion, under which we have groaned for a long time. The Magistrates of Kaskaskias have the honor to address you to employ the credit your command gives you among us, in giving to the Laws their force, and to the Magistrates their respectability, which the unhappiness of the times has deprived them off. The people of this district Sir do not refuse to be under the Administration of a salutary Police, and a good government—But we have experienced such unhappy changes in our administration that the authority of the Magistrate scarcely exists. We are certain Sir, that if you will assemble the people previous to Y9%r departure, and in their presence recommend to them obedience to the Laws, and a proper respect to the Magistrates, that we shall have the satisfaction yet to see, justice, peace, union and happiness reigning among us.

PETITION TO CONGRESS FROM THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY  [August 27, 1787] To the Honorable the Congress of the United-States of North-America The Petition of the American inhabitants of the Illinois “ humbly sheweth That, some time before the epocka that terminated a glorious war and secured independance to the sons of America, Your Petitioners, exhausted by military services & necessary contributions to the support of the Continental armies & other public charges, having nothing left but liberty and Spirits that could neither be borne down under the weight of poverty nor deterred by difficulties, determined to seek an asylum into some of the rich countries which the fate of war had subjected to the American empire. The fame of the fruitfulness of the Illinois lands had reached our ears: thither we directed our wandering course, unmindful of a long & perilous navigation, of the inclemency of the seasons, of the savage fury of innumerable Indian tribes through whom we had to fight our way. Invited to settle here by the ancient inhabitants, allured by the fertility of the soil, and above all encouraged by the hope that our settlements, made under the sanction of the State of Virginia, would be sacred & inattackable, we began to cultivate our lands with that unwearied activity that the love of happiness inspires, but which is only fostered up by the certainty of enjoying property undisturbed. When Virginia ceded this country to Congress, by a Deed subscribed by their Delegates in March 1784,” they stipulated in our behalf that the settlers who had professed themselves citizens of that State should have their possessions & claims confirmed to them; which was agreed to by Congress. Under these circumstances, Your Petitioners humbly conceive that the Proclamations of the Honorable the Congress, forbidding people to settle on the public lands on the North-western Side of the Ohio,” are not in any sense applicable to them. We did not come hither in defiance to the laws of our country, but under the protection of the State of Virginia then Sovereign of this territory: we did not settle on the public unappropriated lands of Congress, but on those that were the property of Virginia, which she has since confirmed, and Congress themselves warranted to us. We claim yet another title which, in our humble opinion, is not of less weight nor less respectable. An opinion has always prevailed in these countries that the french settlers have Charters for extensive tracts of territory; and within the compass as well as upon the faith of those Charters we have Settled ourselves. Such are the grounds on which we stand; but notwithstanding those titles which we had hitherto looked upon as sacred, a discouraging rumour is spread among us, which owes its birth to the Proclamations of Congress lately come to our Knowledge, that all the American settlers on this side the Ohio are to be turned off their lands by the first of September next. This unexpected piece of intelligence, we confess, did at first allarm not a little Your Petitioners; but after recollecting ourselves, trusting in the sacredness of the rights which we derive from the State of Virginia, and confiding in the justice of the Honorable the Congress, we are emboldened to hope that you will be pleased to confirm our possessions by a Solemn Deed, and further to take into your gracious consideration the peculiar circumstances of our hitherto precarious Situation. When we began our Settlements in this country, we found ourselves Surrounded by a great number of Indian tribes whose hostile dispositions towards the Americans did not permit us to extend our culture & define properly the lands which we meant to occupy. Penned up in forts & small garrisons, we have been obliged to raise our subsistance out of a few fields tilled in common; and, after a severe struggle of many years, the greater number among us have not yet been able to ascertain and secure their possessions. In this difficult predicament, Your Petitioners humbly intreat that the Honorable the Congress be pleased to ascertain their unsettled Situation, and confirm to them a Grant of five hundred acres of land for every male inhabitant, without any discrimination of age, or else whatever quantity your wisdom may think proper.—Should this appear to be too great a favour, We beg leave to observe to Your Honorable body that this part of the country is almost entirely destitute of wood, & that this circumstance makes it necessary to have a larger extent of ground to answer the various purposes of husbandry. With a respectful confidence that the Honorable the Congress will not overlook our grounded expectations as claimants under the french Charters, our rights as Settlers under the State of Virginia, and our sufferings as a wandering family, Your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray for the honor welfare & glory of the United-States of North-America.

PETITION OF JOHN CLEVES SYMMES FOR A GRANT OF LAND [August 29, 1787] To his excellency the president of Congress, the petition of John Cleves Symmes” of New Jersey sheweth, That your petitioner encouraged by the resolutions of Congress of the 23" and 27" of July last,” stipulating the conditions of a transfer of federal lands on the Sioto and Muskingum rivers unto Winthrop Seargeant and Manaseh Cutler esquires and their associates of New England, is induced on behalf of the Citizens of the United States westward of Connecticut who also wish to become purchasers of federal lands, to pray that the honorable the Congress will be pleased to direct that a contract be made by the honorable the commissioners of the treasury board with your petitioner for himself and his associates in all respects similar in form and matter to the said grant made to Mess" Sargeant and Cutler differing only in quantity and place where, and instead of two townships for the use of an university, that one only be assigned for the benefit of an academy. That by such transfer to your petitioner and his associates, on their complying with the terms of sale, the fee may pass of all the lands lying within the following limits, viz. Begining at the mouth of the great Miami river, thence runing up the Ohio to the mouth of the little Miami river, thence up the main stream of the little Miami river to the place where a due west line to be continued from the western termination of the northern boundary line of the grant to Mess" Sargeant, Cutler & company shall intersect the said little Miami river, thence due west continuing the said western line to the place where the said line shall intersect the main branch or stream of the great Miami river, thence down the great Miami to the place of begining.

Judge Symms of Jersey yesterday made an application for All that tract of country lying between the Great & little Miami the East & West line & the Ohio supposed about two millions of acres, on the same terms with the Eastern Ohio Comp”—his application has met with the intire approbation of the Members present: & there is no doubt but as soon there is a Congress that this contract will be closed.— A Comm” is appointed to draught an ordnance for indiscriminate locations,” but a difficulty has occurred which I fear will destroy the whole affair: the Comm” don't know what the deficiency is on the Cumberland river & have figured to their timorous & suspicious imaginations that the Virginia officers & soldiers mean to take eight or ten million of acres, between the Scioto & Miami.-The Comme" also contend that the State of Virg" should make proof of the deficiency of good lands on the Cumberland; should ascertain the quantity they want or have a right to on the Northern side of the Ohio; & should then take that quantity in one Body:-I wish you would Speak to our Governor on the subject. Perhaps it may be in his power shortly to obtain information of the quantity claimed by the Officers & Soldiers on the other side of the Ohio: If this fact was known other difficulties might perhaps be got over as I apprehend it is not very considerable.—M" Grayson has been very ill since her lying in, but is now much better. from y' Affect frº & most Obe" Serº WILL" GRAYSON NB—The Missisippi is in a State of absolute dormification.— 
PETITION TO CONGRESS FROM THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY  [September 15, 1787] To the Honorable the Congress of the United-States of North-America The Humble Petition of the french inhabitants of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Prairie du rocher, & village Sº Philipp" Sheweth That the people of this country of the Illinois conceive themselves to be on the eve of total destruction, unless the justice, humanity, & benevolence of the Honorable the Congress hasten to rescue them from impending ruin, by timely taking into their gracious consideration the wretched state of the district. Placed at an immense distance from the seat of the foederal government of America, Your Petitioners have always lived in a dangerous security concerning the lands which they were wont to consider as their own; and it is but of late that they have been awakened to fear & anxiety.” We hear from all quarters that the Wabash & Illinois countries are offered for sale, and that large tracts of these territories have already been purchased. In a few months, perhaps, the whole will be disposed of; and Your Petitioners, whose ancestors made the first Settlements here, & who have been faithfully attached to the United-States from the beginning of the late glorious Revolution, will find themselves contracted within the narrow bounds of the very inconsiderable improvements they have made in the vicinity of their villages. Soon, the industrious Americans will convert our forests into flourishing plantations: their furrows will reach to the fences of our gardens: our peltry-trade, already much decayed, must be entirely annihilated by the rapid march of husbandry, the retreat of the Indian nations, & the flight of the wild game. This accelerated progress of tillage, we Know, is infinitely more beneficial to mankind than the present unimproved state of an extensive & rich country; and we do not wish to check, but to be permitted to partake with our neighbours & friends, the advantages of encouraged activity & industry. As original Settlers, as faithful friends to the cause of independance, as an unhappy people who have lost their all by a System of oppression which we have fully displayed in our Memorial, We beg, & humbly hope that the Honorable the Congress may be graciously pleased to Grant to every male inhabitant of these villages of Kaskaskia Cahokia, Prairie du Rocher, & Sº Philipp, without any discrimination of age, a tract of five hundred acres of land, Gratis & for ever, in the vicinity of their respective villages. full of the most respectful confidence in the equity & generosity of the Honorable the Congress, Your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray for the welfare, honor, & glory of the United-States of North-America.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  PHILADELPHIA Jam”. 27. 1788. SIR It is now near four weeks since I returned from Fort Pitt, and ere this should have waited upon you in person had I not been prevented by a slight indisposition while the daily expectation of being able to do so made me decline writing. I saw Gen' Butler at Carlisle in my way to the westward; but it was the 12* of December, when I was on the return, before I met with him in that Country; the weakness of his leg, and sickness in his family had hindered him from proceeding earlier. The intelligence respecting the disposition of the Indians that I was able to obtain at Fort Pitt was not very satisfactory—indeed it amounted to little more than that they had been extremely anxious to see some persons with authority from the United States to treat with them—that, in that expectation, and in consequence of a request they had made to that purpose, there had been a considerable assembly on the Tawa River,” but their expectations not having been fulfilled, it had been concluded to send one other Message to Congress, and to wait four months for an Answer. The Deputy for Indian Affairs at Fort Pitt had forwarded the Message to the Superintendant without taking a copy so that I had not so perfect an opportunity as I could have wished to judge of its spirit. I have however taken measures to be informed of what passed at that meeting, and to get probably at the bottom of their designs which with them as well as more civilized nations, are not always what they are professed to be, and about the 1* of March I expect to be possessed of it.—From all accounts however there is a great deal of uneasiness amongst them, and it is clear to me that, if it cannot be removed, a very general War will ensue. Whether that uneasiness can be removed I own, I think doubtful, for though we hear much of the Injuries and depredations that are committed by the Indians upon the Whites, there is too much reason to believe that at least equal if not greater Injuries are done to the Indians by the frontier settlers of which we hear very little.—It was notwithstanding my decided opinion that the treaty ought to be made, and in that opinion Gen' Butler perfectly coincided; and the falls of Muskinghum is fixed upon for the place of treaty, and Invitations have been sent by the Superintendant to the different nations to meet us there on the first of May next, a point of time that was supposed to be as early in the season as they could attend at, and a place more equally convenient to them, and us, than any other they would agree to.—It is about seventy miles from the mouth of the river and navigable for boats to the spot. The mode I think of for managing the Treaty is this—that the Goods be deposited in the Fort at the mouth of the river while Gen' Butler and myself meet the Indians at the Falls.-Should the business come to a favorable issue they can easily be brought up and distributed,—If it does not come to a favorable issue they are in safety. I have great reason to expect that the meeting will be very numerous, and it is therefore to be regretted that the Finances of the United States would not permit a more liberal appropriation of money,” more especially as the objects are very important in many points of view, and that they are frequently receiving very great presents from the British—last autumn Six thousand pounds sterling in money, under the Idea of a compensation for losses sustained by them in the late war, and Goods to an equal value were distributed among them by that Nation,” and notwithstanding the advice they receive from Lord Dorchester to remain at peace with the United States, there can be little doubt that the jealousies they entertain and the uneasinesses which agitate them, are fomented by the Agents of that Crown. It was a great disappointment that I could not avail myself of the liberty you were pleased to grant to open any letters from Gen! Harmar to you which I might meet with on the way—The intelligence they must have contained, would have determined me as to the necessity of inviting the Nations upon the Wabash. I saw at Fort Pitt Lieutenant Smith who had been with Gen' Harmar in that Country, but could get nothing from him that was satisfactory, and therefore concluded it would be proper to invite them and they have accordingly been invited—their distant situation however renders it probable that they will not come in numbers. On the whole Sir, it appears to me from every view I could take of this subject, and every Information that I have been able to obtain that the proposed Establishments in the Country north west of the Ohio, and the further sale of lands there for the discharge of the public debt depend entirely on a solid Peace with the Indians.—to effect that no pains will be spared on my part, yet after all that can be done unless the Inhabitants of the States that border upon them can be restrained from acts of violence and injustice towards them, it can never be of long continuance. A General Indian War, while it would involve thousands in the most extreme distress, would be attended with such an expence as our present situation would render highly unadviseable. I have the honor to be with great respect Sir Your most Obedient Humble Servant. (signed) A* Sº CLAIR. THE HON” MAJOR GENERAL KNOX Secretary at War.  Nº 6. 
SECRETARY SARGENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR, BOSTON, the 17" of February, 1788. DEAR SIR, I heard by the Post of the 13" inst., that your Excellency was in York, which determined me immediately to be there, and I made my arrangements accordingly; but a letter last night from General Knox, which informed me that you had left the City, and would not go into the Western Country until April, has induced me to postpone my journey so that I may be present at the meeting of the Ohio Company in Providence on the first Wednesday of March. I conceive it will be my duty, and I assure you it is very much my inclination to accompany your Excellency if agreeable; and you will favour me with information of your departure. I have obtained from the Secretary's office in this Commonwealth copies of Civil and Military Commissions, Passports, &c., &c. &c., some of which I intended to have printed in this town from my own finance, but General Varnum * observed to me, that your Excellency and all the Judges would probably be together in York in this Month, where we should have it in our power to draw on the publick funds, and that it might be your pleasure to make some material alterations in the forms, which has hitherto prevented me from doing any thing in the business. With your Excellency's advice and instruction I will (if you think proper) attend to it in New York, where I shall be by the 15th of March. Military Commissions and Civil Commissions for the Peace will, I presume, be very essential at an early period, and perhaps others. The Publick Seal can be cut in New York or Philadelphia, and I shall, if your Excellency will favour me with order and a device, apply to an Engraver without delay. If there be any services within my ability, officially, or in a private character that I can render your Excellency, I wish you to command me with the greatest degree of freedom. I have the honour to be, my dear Sir, with very high respect and esteem, your most obedient and humble servant, W. SARGENT. 
EXPLANATORY MEMORIAL FROM POST VINCENNES AND THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY  [February 28, 1788) To the Honorable the Congress of the United-States of North-America The french inhabitants of Poste Vincennes on the Wabash; Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Prairie du rocher, & village Sº Philipp in the Illinois country, impressed with the most respectful confidence that their respective Petitions, praying for a gift of five hundred acres of land to every male inhabitant, will be favorably regarded by the Honorable the Congress, beg leave further to elucidate their situation & the objects of their demands.” The inhabitants of Poste Vincennes possess, Since the epocka of their first settlement, a Common pasture-ground for their cattle, under one fence, of about two miles in depth & eight miles in front, two thirds of which are ponds & impracticable morasses. A few among them took up, under the authority of their former governors, small tracts in the woods of between eight & twelve acres in Superficies, where they used to make their sugar, & which, from that circumstance, they call their sugar-camps. All the farming lands which they have formerly obtained, besides their Common, do not amount to four, or at most, five thousand acres. Since the conquest made of that country by the State of Virginia, the Court has granted to every American adventurer four hundred acres, subject to such regulations as might be made hereafter by Congress. Not half a dozen of the french have availed themselves of that opportunity of obtaining lands. Their Charter, or the cession made them by the Pianquicha “ Indians in the year 1768 begins at Pointe coupée "twelve leagues above the Poste by water, down to the mouth of White river twelve leagues below said Poste; and is to extend forty leagues to the Eastward & thirty to the Westward which contains about eight millions of acres. All the bottom from the mouth of the Kaskaskia river to Prairie du rocher, & from the hills along that river to the Mississipi has been long since apportioned by government to the inhabitants of these two villages, & contains from eighteen to twenty thousand acres; and, as the number of their male inhabitants is two hundred and Seventy, this gives Seventy four acres to every one of them, including their Common which is very extensive. The Deputy County-Lieutenant of this district,” in conformity to the direction of Colonel Todd "* appointed by the State of Virginia County-Lieutenant, has granted to some few Americans & french tracts of Eighty, One hundred & Sixty, and three hundred acres, subject to be hereafter controuléd by Congress. The Jesuits had at Kaskaskia a grant from the King of france of four Square leagues.” The village of Cahokia is included within a grant of four square leagues made in the year 1742 by Mess" De Boisbriant & Desursins Commandants to the Missionaries of the order of Sº Sulpice.” In 1768, the Bishop of Quebec & these fathers ceded to the inhabitants of Cahokia the usufruit of this grant.” Within its bounds they have the few improvements they have made; and some concessions have been granted by their court to the Americans Settled at Grandruisseau,” two leagues & a half from the village. The remainder of the Americans live on the intermediate Space between village S' Philipp & the boundaries of the Cahokia Grant.” from these premises it will appear why the inhabitants of Cahokia did not join with the other districts in giving up their Charter, because it is not immediately vested in them. The inhabitants of Poste Vincennes & the Several districts of the Illinois, in consequence of the above Statement, presume with diffidence to pray, That the five hundred acres of land, for which they have petitioned the Honorable the Congress, may be granted to them, exclusive of the small tracts they are already possessed of in virtue of concessions to them made, previous to the country being taken possession of by the State of Virginia. That it be ordered that all the grants made by the County-Lieutenant or his deputy, and by our respective courts, since we became subjects of Virginia, shall be confirmed to the respective Grantees; provided that so much as has been so conceded to them shall be part of what may be granted by Congress. That, in consideration of the poverty of the inhabitants, the fees of the Surveyors, employed in laying off the different tracts that may be granted to these districts, be paid by Congress. That, as an alleviation of our distresses & losses during these ten last years, the lands of the french inhabitants of these districts may be exempted from taxation for so long as it will please Congress to order it. That the lands to be granted to the french & American inhabitants of Poste Vincennes, on the Eastern side of the Wabash, begin at the upper opening of the false channel vulgarly called Le faux chenal, thence going up the Wabash, so that the depth from this river shall be one third of the length along said river, & include the whole quantity. That the boundaries of the lands to be granted to the french & American inhabitants of the different districts of the Illinois be from the mouth of the Rivière à Marie,” up & along the Mississippi to the upper limit of the Cahokia Charter, along said limit to a North-& southline that shall intersect an East-& West line from the mouth of the Rivière à Marie, so as to include the whole quantity. And finally, that the grants to the french be distinguish’d & separate from those to be made to the American inhabitants. New york february 28* 1788.

THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS  WAR OFFICE, March 10° 1788– SIR. I have the honor to submit to Congress, a report of the measures which have been adopted, in consequence of their directions of the 22'nd of October last,” respecting the lands appropriated to satisfy the bounties due the late army of the United States, and also, to state some circumstances relative to claims for lands, by certain descriptions of officers, on which it may be necessary for Congress to decide. The numerous speculations, or transfers of the real and supposed claims of individuals, for lands, rendered it highly proper to ascertain the names of all persons originally entitled to lands, by the resolves of Congress. Accurate lists are therefore making out, at the office of the Commissioner of army accounts of all the legal claimants. The muster rolls from time to time are the only genuine means to guard against fraud in this case. The alphabetical lists which are forming from them are considerably advanced, and will probably be completed in three months. The work which is very voluminous will be important for other public objects than the one herein specified. I applied, early after Congress passed the before recited resolve of the 22'nd of October, to the Geographer to have the tract situated at the mouth of the Ohio surveyed—He expressed his readiness to direct the surveys, but required, as an indispensible preliminary, an advance of twelve hundred dollars, without which, the persons in the department could not undertake the business—The board of treasury, on a request for this sum, stated, that the situation of the treasury would not admit of any advance to the surveyor's department. Being desirous that the orders of Congress should be promptly executed in this respect, I suggested the expedient of the surveys being performed, under the direction of the Geographer, by some of the military officers on the Ohio–The board of treasury, and the Geographer agreeing with me in the propriety and oeonomy of the measure, I directed Brigadier General Harmar to appoint suitable officers to survey the exterior lines of the tract, at the junction of the Ohio, with the Mississippi, according to the mode which should be pointed out by the Geographer *—I stated explicitly, that for this service the officers were not to expect any compensation. But I informed him that the tracts would be divided into lots, and that for the surveys of such lots as should have been alienated by the persons originally entitled, a reasonable price would probably be fixed, by which the officers would be compensated for their trouble in making the surveys. I humbly presume, that it is the intention of Congress, that the officers and soldiers possessing their own rights to land should have the quantity to which they are respectively entitled, surveyed and delivered to them free of all expences whatever. But, as a very great proportion of the persons originally entitled, have transferred their claims to Speculators for inadequate considerations, the public are not obliged perhaps to survey and deliver such lands free of all expence. Were the whole quantity due the late army to be surveyed into lots of the sizes stipulated, the cost of the surveys would probably exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollarſs, a sum, far exceeding the public ability to furnish for the object—As this is a point on which the decision of Congress may be considered as necessary, the following resolve is submitted. Resolved, That all officers and soldiers of the late army of the United States, possessing their rights to the bounty lands stipulated by the resolves of Congress, shall have the quantity to which they are respectively entitled, surveyed and delivered to them without any expence whatever—That the army rights to lands which may have been alienated, be charged only with the actual expences of surveying the same.” A mode for the distribution of the lands will be formed and hereafter submitted to Congress.” Some doubts have arisen whether the officers who were deranged in 1778 and 1779 were entitled to lands:–But I presume a recurrence to the original resolve on this subject of the 16'th of September 1776,” will fully establish their right—It is there stipulated that lands shall be granted “to the officers and soldiers who shall engage in the service, and continue therein until the end of the war, or until discharged by Congress, and to the representatives of such officers and soldiers as shall be slain by the enemy” An officer who resigned, and voluntarily quitted the service was clearly precluded from land and other emoluments—But in the case of a derangement by Congress, he is entitled to all the stipulations made previously to his discharge—The officers who were discharged in 1778 and 1779 received one year's pay in a depreciated paper as a gratuity, but there were not any resolves of Congress which deprived them of the lands. Some doubts have also been suggested respecting the lands which have been alienated since the war by the officers and soldiers originally entitled—The preamble of the resolve of Congress of the 20'th of September 1776* precluded the sale of the lands only during the war, and the resolve founded thereon ought not to have a more extensive construction—The resolve itself, however seems to preclude any assignment without limitation of time—But as this could not probably have been the meaning of Congress the assignments clearly made since the war will be considered as valid, unless it should please Congress otherwise to direct. Should the mode herein suggested for the survey of the outlines of the tract at the mouth of the Ohio, meet with the approbation of Congress the outlines of the reserved tract north of the purchase of Cutler and Sargent could also be surveyed by the same means:* And if a discrimination could with propriety be made between unalienated and alienated lots, so that the latter should be charged with a reasonable price for the expence of surveying, the whole of the army lands might be delivered to the persons entitled thereto, without any expence to the public.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE BOARD OF TREASURY, NEW YORK, March [14] 1788. GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to return you enclosed the Warrant upon the State of Pennsylvania for one thousand dollars which you were pleased to furnish me with for the purposes of the Indian treaty, immediately on my arrival in Philadelphia. I presented it to the Receiver of Continental taxes there, who informed me that, if the Treasurer of the State would make the payment he would instantly do what was necessary on his part. I made application to the Treasurer, who said he could pay no monies on any account, without the orders of the Executive Council, and at any rate he could not pay one farthing in specie, nor could he devise any means of procuring specie, other than that the Council should empower him to sell as much paper as would raise the sum mentioned in the Warrant. I then addressed the Council, and stated to them as an inducement for their compliance, the very great interest the State had in the event of the proposed Treaty with the Indians. They would do nothing in the matter, but as the Assembly were to meet in a few days, &c., desired that I would not return the Warrant then, and that my letter to them should be laid before the House. That was done, and a Committee to whom it was referred reported that they could devise no means for the payment, which report was adopted. As that money is essentially necessary, indeed the business cannot go on without it, I have to request that the Board will furnish it in some other way. Every thing else that is necessary has been procured and sent forward to Fort Pitt. I have the honour, &c. Signed, ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 
THE HONOURABLE BOARD OF TREASURY. B. TARDIWEAU TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR [March 20, 1788) SIR. The french and American inhabitants of Poste Vincennes & the Illinois take the liberty to address Your Excellency as their natural patron & protector, and humbly hope that the love of justice & benevolence by which you are so eminently characterize will induce You to afford them that Support which their respect prompts them to look for in the paternal affection of Your Excellency. They have had the honour to present to Congress Several Petitions & Memorials, tending to obtain five hundred acres of land for every male inhabitant of their respective districts; * and flatter themselves that this demand will meet with the gracious compliance of that Honorable Body. But it may perhaps happen that they might think proper to put off the final decision of this business untill Your Excellency has taken up his residence in this country of which we are happy to hear that you have been appointed Governor. Should such a delay be likely to take place, we beg leave to acquaint Your Excellency with our fears, and to sollicit your Honorable mediation to the end that the hopes we have presumed to conceive may not be blasted by the event. We understand that Your Excellency is going to hold a treaty with the Northern Indians: that will in all appearance detain you two or three months; the journey to Poste Vincennes & from thence to the different districts of the Illinois, the organization of Your Government in those Several parts of it, the time necessary to obtain the information which you may wish to transmit to Congress, and the long interval that Shall elapse before your dispatches can reach that Honorable Body; all these circumstances put it beyond any doubt that it will be the Spring next year before they Shall receive them. A Congress composed of new members will have at that time succeeded the present one, and there will be a necessity of going thro' the whole business over again. And if their attention was taken up with matters of greater moment, such as the establishment of the New Constitution, as it is probable it Shall, our interests, it is to be fear'd, will be laid aside. During that period, which will be lengthened by our uneasiness & apprehensions, lands may be Sold by Congress, and not unlikely those very lands that join us. Where, then, shall we take refuge? What remedy shall we Seek from distress and poverty? If we dar'd to Surmise that Congress have no other motive for that delay than a desire of Knowing who, among the American Settlers, is entitled to a gift of land, we wou'd offer it as our humble opinion that the Charter, if Congress are pleas'd to grant us one, might be express'd in a manner that wou'd exclude all illegal claims, by giving [blank] Hundred acres to every American who had resided in these districts before the 1* of March 1784 at which epocha the State of Virginia ceded this country to Congress. Confident, Sir, that Your Excellency's paternal heart will feel a pure Satisfaction at having it in your pow'r to signalize the first deed of your government by an act of benevolence, and at observing at your landing that gratitude will be the first Sentiment that shall meet you, we humbly intreat Your Excellency to deign to Support the weak efforts of our Agent in our behalf. With the most profound respect, we have the honor to be Sir Your Excellency's Most obedient most humble Servants in behalf of the french & American inhabitants of Poste Vincennes & the Illinois B: TARDIVEAU Agent NEW-YORK March 20th 1788. 
HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR Sº CLAIR REPORT OF THE SECRETARY AT WAR: INDIAN AFFAIRS [March 31, 1788] The Secretary of the United States for the Department [of] War to whom was referred a letter of the 11" of March 1788 to from the Superintendant of Indian affairs for the Northern district.— Reports, That it is to be regretted that every arrangement of military posts for the protection of the frontiers is exceedingly defective compared with the importance of Niagara and Detroit. That by the said posts being unjustly with-held from the United States, they are not only constrained to make inadequate establishments for the defence of the frontiers but are subjected to excessive expences by being obliged to transport all their supplies upwards of three hundred miles by land. That untill the United States are in possession of said posts not only the before recited evils will be continued, but it is to be apprehended no solid peace can be effected with the Indians. That the opinion of the Superintendant with respect to the establishment of posts at the Miami Village and at Cayahoga would be well founded were existing circumstances favorable to the plan. That posts being established at said places must depend on one or the other of the following circumstances—Either the Indians must sincerely concur in the measure, or the posts and garrisons themselves must be so strong, and possess such communications, as to bid defiance to the force of the Indians. To attempt the establishment of small posts far advanced into the country in the present irritated temper of the Indians would most probably accelerate a war which it is highly the interest of the United States to avoid. A post of five hundred men being established at the Miami Village at the rapids of the Miami river,” which runs into Lake Erie, would be highly advantageous to the Indian trade and the security of the frontiers. But the said post ought to be supported by others so as to have a free communication by the way of the Wabash, as well as Lake Erie. Should the Indians at the ensuing treaty receive favorably the proposition, a considerable post might this year be established at Cayahoga river, which runs into Lake Erie—Should they be averse to the design it must be deferred.—For the troops on the frontiers will be too much reduced to attempt the establishment by force—and it is uncertain whether the Treasury will be able to furnish money to recruit others to supply their places. The average number of troops on the frontiers during the present year will not exceed three hundred and fifty, unless exigencies should arise to induce the States to furnish the public treasury better than otherwise it will be. Hence it will appear that any capital alteration of the posts will depend on the issue of the ensuing Indian Treaty combined with other causes. Your Secretary will request early information of the Commissioners with respect to the dispositions of the Indians on this point, which with any propositions arising therefrom shall be submitted to Congress for their decision. All which is humbly submitted. H KNOX WAR OFFICE March 31* 1788.  31 March 1788.

THE SECRETARY OF CONGRESS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  NEW YORK April 11. 1788 DEAR SIR, Upon my arrival here I found a letter from Mr Etwein." enclosing one for you which I forward herewith. He informs me that the letter to you is from the Agents for the Missions of the United brethren, in behalf of the remains of the Christian Indians who were driven from Muskingum. Such is my Confidence in your humanity that I am sure they will not plead in vain. I beg leave to submit to your consideration how far it may proper to quiet the minds of the Delaware in Respect to the mournful Slaughter of their friends & relations on the Muskingum & to remove from their thoughts every idea of its being a measure of Government & whether it might not be well, in case they bring forward a complaint on this account to inform them how much the act was disapproved of by Congress and what pain it gave them that the Nations who were at war with us should have been the cause or given pretext for the detested deed, by opening a war path through the towns of those innocent people & previously removing them to Sandusky I hoped to have had the pleasure of seeing you in Philadelphia, but when I called I found you were gone to visit your family. I heartily wish you success in your Negotiations, & happiness in the administration of your government, Always with sincere respect Dear Sir Your most obed" & Most humble Serv" To GOV" St CLAIR 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY AT WAR: INDIAN AFFAIRS  [May 2, 1788) The Secretary of the United States for the department of war, to whom was referred a letter of the 14'th of March 1788,” from the Governor of the Western territory, Reports;” That the confederation of a large number of tribes of Indians, to oppose the settlement of the lands, North of the river Ohio, is a subject of great importance, and seriously claims the attention of the United States. That the said tribes of Indians have expressed the highest disgust, at the principle of conquest, which has been specified to them, as the basis of their treaties with the United States, and in consequence of 12,000 acres in the Tuscarawas Valley for converted Indians. In 1787 he revived the Society of United Brethren for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen which, the limits of their hunting grounds and territory, have been circumscribed and defined.” That the practice of the British government, and most of the Northern colonies previously to the late war, of purchasing the right of the soil of the Indians, and receiving a deed of sale and conveyance of the same, is the only mode of alienating their lands, to which they will peaceably accede. That to attempt to establish a right to the lands claimed by the Indians, by virtue of an implied conquest, will require the constant employment of a large body of troops, or the utter extirpation of the indians. That circumstanced as they are at present, being in alliance with, and favorably treated by, the British government, the doctrine of conquest is so repugnant to their feelings, that rather than submit thereto, they would prefer continual war. That the principle of waging war for an object which may be obtained by a treaty, is justly to be questioned. That at the ensuing treaty, it is highly probable, the indians will, in the first instance object to the right of the United States to the country North of the Ohio. If the Commissioners, who are to hold the treaty, are bound by instructions to adhere rigidly to the principle of conquest, and the limits of territory stated at the former treaties, an abrupt departure of the Indians, and hostilities in consequence thereof, may be expected. Your Secretary humbly apprehends that the United States may conform to the modes and customs of the indians in the disposal of their lands, without the least injury to the national dignity. Were an opposition to the custom of the indians in this respect to be a material part of national character, it would not be highly estimated in the opinion of the world. But, your Secretary conceives that the Commissioners may negociate an extinguishment of the indian claims, to the territory described by former treaties, and perhaps to the further extension defined in the instructions to the Governor of the Western territory without calling in question the validity of the said treaties—In case of a new purchase, or the modification of the former boundaries, a sum of money may be given according to the indian custom, on the chiefs signing the deeds in the usual form. As an extensive indian war in the present political crisis, and with an exhausted treasury, would be an event pregnant with unlimited evil, your Secretary submits, with all deference, the consideration of the propriety of so modifying the instructions to the Governor of the Western territory, and the Superintendant of Indian Affairs, as to admit of their extinguishing, by purchase, the indian claims to the Western country, described in the former treaties, with such additions, as the said commissioners shall be able to effect. That the sum to be given, for the complete extinguishment of the indian claims to the said country, be limited to the sum of forty thousand dollars. That one third of the said sum be paid in money, or goods, on the signing of the deeds at the ensuing treaty; one third, in the year 1789; and the remainder, in the year 1790; to be delivered on such days in the years aforesaid, and at such places, as shall be mutually agreed on. All of which is humbly submitted to Congress. H KNOX  2 May 1788.

their minds, to maintain them on their just rights, and extend to them the liberality of the United states they Submit the following resolutions viz— Resolved that the Governor of the Western Territory shall cause to be surveyed and laid out, as soon as may be a tract of land upon the Wabash River bounded in the following manner to wit?"—beginning at the place where the River a Maries

with that line to the Wabash and across the same twenty miles thence due north so far as to meet a due west line drawn from the point of beginning—Also one other tract of land upon the Mississippi bounded in the following manner viz. beginning at the mouth of the wood River and running with the southern boundary line of a tract of land lately agreed for by the Board of Treasury with Messrs Flint & Parker to the Kaskaskias River thence Southerly untill it meets the Mississippi at the mouth of the River au Vase—thence with that River to the place of beginning and including all the Islands

within the Tract agreed for with Flint & Parker upon the Illinois River, & the rights of each as may have been settled therein and provided for by the agreement with them— Resolved—that the Governor of the Western territory shall cause as soon as may be, due enquiry to be made into the claims to lands of the Inhabitants of the Country upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers, and where it shall be ascertained either by Records that have been preserved in the Country or by authentic writings in the Possession of the parties claiming which may not have been recorded that lands may have been

the Heirs or legal Representatives of any persons who have heretofore been inhabitants of the same—that they or their Predecessors respectively had acquired equitable or Customary rights to Lands shall cause to be surveyed for each on their applying for the same, and at their Proper Costs and Charges four hundred acres of Lands within either of the beforedescribed Tracts of Land, in that upon the Wabash for the Inhabitants upon the Wabash—and in that upon the Mississippi for those upon the Mississippi—and issue letters Patent under the seal of the Government granting the same to the individuals and to their Heirs and Assigns forever * And whereas the Country upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers was by the treaty of Paris 1763 ceded to the Crown of Great Britain and grants of land may have been made to Individuals inhabiting there by the officers of that Crown Resolved that the Governor of the Western territory shall cause like enquiries to be made as in the cases of the ancient French inhabitants and order the lands to be surveyed and laid out for them respectively within the bounds of the before described tracts of Lands, and under the same limitations and restrictions Issue letters Patent confirming the same to them and their Heirs and Assigns respectively forever— And whereas from the conquest of the Country upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers untill the Cession made by the State of Virginia to the United States the same was under the Government and dominion of that State, & many persons may have removed during that period into the said Country and have acquired legal or equitable Titles to lands, under the laws or Customs of Virginia Resolved that the Governor of the Western territory shall cause due enquiry to be made into the same and upon the same being ascertained: to order the lands to be surveyed and laid out for the Persons claiming the same their Heirs or legal representatives within either of the before described tracts of Land, and Issue letters Patent confirming them, to them, and their Heirs and Assigns forever under and Subject to the same Regulations limitations and restrictions as are prescribed in the Case of the french and English Inhabitants— And whereas it may be that within the boundaries of the before described Tracts of land upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers after all the claims of the inhabitants, whether legal or equitable—to any quantity of Land—not exceeding four hundred acres for each— shall have been satisfied there may yet remain an over plus—Resolved that the Governor of the Western Territory may, and he is hereby empowered and directed upon application to order the same to be surveyed and laid out for any person or persons in quantities not exceeding four hundred acres for each applicant and to Issue letters Patent, granting and confirming the same to the said applicants respectively and to their Heirs and assigns for ever they paying for the same at the rate of [blank] pracre—any thing in the powers to the board of Treasury to dispose of western territory notwithstanding, out of which powers the before described tracts of Land upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers are hereby expressly excepted. Resolved that where the Claims to Lands of the Inhabitants of the Country upon the Wabash and Mississippi Rivers—whether legal or equitable do not amount to four hundred acres for each—the Governor of the Western territory may and he is hereby empowered at the request of the Parties—to grant to the Parties a quantity in addition that shall make up four hundred acres for each Inhabitant and provided that in all cases where the Claim exceeds that Quantity he shall report the same with all the Circumstances attending it to Congress for their Decision—And to the end that the business may be conducted with safety and propriety as well for the United States as for the Individuals interested.

Under the above circumstances, the Board are of opinion, that it would be adviseable to enter into a Contract with Mº Morgan, and his associates, on the same terms, as have been agreed on, on the application of Royal Flint and Joseph Parker; should Congress judge it adviseable (previous to the termination of the approaching Treaty) to enter into any further Contracts for Lands, where the Indian Title has not been extinguished.— With respect to the application of the Memorialists on the Form of Government which they wish to be Established, within the proposed Purchase; the Board forbear to make any observations as they presume this Object (being of a positive nature, and not necessarily connected with the Business of their Department) was not intended by Congress to form part of the subject in Reference.— All of which is humbly Submitted.

Beg leave to Report That the Resolves of Congress of the 23° 79 & 27** July 24 81 and 22** of October last relative to Contracts for Lands in the Western Territory all stand on the same principles; Except in one article of the Agreement proposed to be made with Mess. Flint and Parker; * by which the United States stipulate to extinguish the Indian Title, instead of the same being done by the Contractors agreeably to their proposition. - That no Contract has been completed in consequence of the Resolves of Congress above stated; except with Messrs. Sarjeant & Cutler:* the Board not conceiving themselves authorised to conclude any Contract, till the first installment is paid on the respective purchases. That assurances have been given to the Board of the intentions of Mr Symmes, and of Messrs. Flint and Parker to fulfill their proposed Contracts; except in the case of the Two Million Acre Tract on the Wabash—which the Attorney of Mº Flint in this City informs the Board cannot (he presumes) be complied with for want of a sufficient number of subscribers to complete the Purchase.— With respect to that part of the proposed Contract with Messrs. Flint and Parker; which differs in the point we have suggested from the other propositions—Congress will observe that it necessarily arises, from the Indian Title to the same not being extinguished; which is not the case of the other proposed Contracts; and consequently that the agreement with Messrs. Flint and Parker (should it take effect) will stand precisely on the same grounds with those abovementioned.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE: MEMORIAL OF GEORGE MORGAN  [June 20, 1788) The com" consisting of Mº Williamson Mº Dane M' Carrington Mº Kearny and Mº Wingate to whom was referred a memorial of George Morgan * and his associates respecting a tract of land in the Illinois country on the Mississippi having reported thereon and their report being amended to read as follows" “That there are sundry french settlements on the river Mississippi within the tract which Mº Morgan and his associates propose to purchase.” Near the mouth of the river Kaskaskies, there is a village which appears to have contained near eighty families from the beginning of the late revolution. There are twelve families in a small village at la prairie du rochers, and near fifty families at the Kahokia village. There are also four or five families at fort Chartres and Sº Philips which is five miles farther up the river. The heads of families in those villages appear each of them to have had a certain quantity of arable land alloted to them and a proportionate quantity of meadow and of wood land or pasture. Your Committee are of the opinion that from any general sale which may be made of the lands on the Mississippi there should at least be a reserve of so much land as may satisfy all the just claims of the ancient settlers on that river and that they should be confirmed in the possession of such lands as they may have had at the beginning of the late revolution, which may have been allotted to them according to the laws or usages of the governments under which they have respectively settled. And whereas an additional quantity of land may be necessary for the suport of those people whenever the settlement shall encrease, and the indian trade, by which they have chiefly subsisted shall become less profitable, your com” are of the opinion that such allowance should also be made to them within the reserved limits. Your Committee observe that in the contract which is already made for the sale of a tract of land in the Western country, the purchasers are to be charged with surveying three lots which are reserved for the benefit of the United States. They conceive that future contractors may be relieved from this expence, but they would propose that every agreement hereafter to be made shall be equally binding on the contracting parties, whereupon they submit the following resolves That the board of treasury be authorized to contract with any person or persons for a grant of a tract of land, which shall be bounded as follows Beginning on the rive Au vase in the parallel of latitude of the mouth of little Wabash river, thence running due north to the parallel of latitude which passes through the mouth of Wood river, thence west to the Mississippi at the mouth of Wood river, thence down the river Mississippi to the mouth of the river Au vase, thence up the said river to the place of beginning, under the exceptions and reservations herein after mentioned. That the purchaser or purchasers shall oblige themselves to lay off the tract at their own expence into townships or fractional parts of townships, & to divide the same into lots according to the land ordinance of the 20" May 1785,” compleat returns of which are to be made to the board of treasury. The lot N 16 in each township or fractional part of a township to be given perpetually for the purposes contained in the said Ordinance; and the lot N 29 in each township or fractional part of a township to be given perpetually for the purposes of religion; and that each of the several townships shall be thus laid off before the original purchaser or purchasers shall have disposed of the same or made any settlement therein. The price to be not less than two thirds of a dollar per acre for the contents of the said tract, except the reservations and gifts herein mentioned, payable in specie, loan office certificates reduced to specie value, or certificates of liquidated debts of the United States; the principal only of the said certificates to be received in payment; And the board of treasury, for such interest as may be due on the certificates, rendered in payment as aforesaid, prior to the first day of January 1787, shall issue indents for interest to the possessors which shall be receivable in payment as other indents for interest of the existing requisitions of Congress; and for such interest as may be due on the said certificates between that period and the time of payment the board shall issue indents, the payment of which to be provided for hereafter. That part of the purchase money, not less than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars shall be paid down upon the closing of the contract, and the remainder of the purchase money, whenever the indian claim shall have been extinguished and the boundary line of the tract run by the geographer of the United States or his assistant, the contents of the land which is to be sold ascertained and a plot of the same returned to the office of the treasury board; on which payment a grant shall be made and the purchaser or purchasers shall have the right of entry and occupancy.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE: THE UNITED LAND COMPANIES OF THE ILLINOIS AND WABASH  [June 27, 1788) The Committee Consisting of [blank] to whom was referred the Memorial of James Wilson Esq. in behalf of Sundry persons calling themselves the United Land Companies of the Illinois and Wabash, report That the Memorial Represents that on the 5* day of July 1773, the Chiefs and Sachems of the Illinois Nations by their Deed, granted to the Several persons therein named, and who are since known by the name of the Illinois Company, two Several Tracts of Land therein bounded and described, on the East side of the Mississippi and in the Country of the Illinois.-And that on the 18" day of October 1775, the Chiefs and Sachems of the Several tribes of the Piankashaw Indians by their Deed duly executed, granted to the persons therein named, and who are since known by the name of the Wabash Company two other several tracts of Land therein bounded and described Situate on both sides of the River Wabash. The said Memorialist further Represents that if the said Purchases upon a full enquiry shall appear to have been fairly made with the Indians and Valuable considerations paid, the same will prevent the Necessity and expence of a Second purchase of the same Lands by the United States, in which case the companys wish not to Retain the whole of the said purchased Tracts, but think themselves entitled to at least a part thereof as a compensation for the money they have expended, the pains they have taken, and the time they have employed in this business. From which Statement your Committee beg leave to Remark, that altho the purchases above mentioned do not Appear to have been made at a general treaty with the Indians, or under legal Authority with all the formalities Customary to give validity to such a transaction; and however improper it may be in general to countenance private purchases from the Indians, yet, considering all Circumstances attending the purchases in question, in case the same upon full investigation shall Appear to have been fairly conducted, and that on Account thereof the United States will be ultimately benefited by an exemption from the expence of purchasing the same Lands, your Committee are of Opinion a Reasonable Compensation in Land should be made to the said companies.” In Order therefore that Congress may obtain the information necessary to render justice in the Premises. the following Resolution is Submitted. That the Governor of the Western territory with the Superintendent of Indian affairs be directed to receive such information and documents, as the persons Stiling themselves the United Land Companies of the Ilinois & Wabash, shall think proper to furnish them with, respecting the Purchases by them Alledged to have been made of the Indians on the Rivers Mississippi and Wabash in the years 1773 & 1775. and at the Ensuing treaty to be held with the Indians make due enquiry into the same, and avail themselves thereof at said treaty so far as may be consistent with the Justice and Dignity of the United States, and Report to Congress a full State of their enquiry, and of their proceedings in Consequence thereof.  124 Report of a Comittee on the Memorial of James Wilson Esq" in behalf of the United Land Companies of the Illinois and Wabash.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR —July 2–1788– Additional Instructions" to the Governor of the territory of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio, relative to the treaty to be held with the western Indians in pursuance of the resolutions of Congress passed in Oct' last – SIR, An additional Sum of twenty thousand dollars has been appropriated for the purposes of procuring a permanent peace with the Indian tribes, with which You are authorised to hold a treaty. This sum of six thousand dollars out of the fourteen thousand heretofore appropriated for holding the said treaty are particularly directed to be applied solely to the purpose of obtaining a boundary advantageous to the United States, between them and the said Indian tribes, and for further extinguishing by purchase Indian titles in case it can be done on terms beneficial to the Union.”— But it is not expected that any further purchases of lands will be made unless on terms evidently advantageous to the United States, or that any part of the said additional sum will be expended, but in cases apparently necessary.— In fixing a boundary between the United States and the Indian tribes, instead of the East & West Line mentioned in Your Instructions & You will endeavor to establish an East & West Line as far North as the completion of the forty first degree of North Latitude. In Your negotiations with the Indians You will make immediate payments so far as You shall have monies in hand, but in case You shall find it necessary to engage any considerable part of the said additional sum You are to stipulate that the payments thereof be made in two or three equal annual installments, the first to be as late in the Year 1789 as can be obtained.— CHA* THOMSON secy—  Entd in Book Reports & Communications Fol: 1. . 1" Sess Ex. 1" Con.

I now inclose a resolve of Congress of the '2nd instant for, appropriating a further sum of twenty-thousand dollars to the department under your direction, on the principles therein specified." I also inclose you the instructions of Congress for the appropriation of the same." As these papers are of the highest importance for you to possess as soon as possible I shall transmit them by the post to Philadelphia, and direct Mr Hodgdon 7 to forward them to you with all possible expedition by express. It may not be improper for me to intimate to you the anxiety of Congress to hear from you in the present state of affairs, and of the dependance they place on your abilities, and that of the, Superintendent for quieting all disturbances among the indians. I feel great satisfaction, that Congress has been pleased to make this further appropriation, as I hope it will be the means of accomplishing effectually the public expectations. I am Sir with the highest respect, Your most obed" and very humble Serv't H KNOX THE HONORABLE THE GOVERNOR OF THE WESTERN TERRITORY.  War Office July 3° 1788
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  PITTSBURGH July 5* 1788. SIR/ Since I had the honor to drop you a hasty line by General Irwine with the latest intelligence then from the Indian Country. Gen' Butler has received a letter from the persons sent to invite the Indians dated the 14" of June a Copy of which I now enclose. It is not a little extraordinary that a meeting which was desired with so much earnestness by the Savages, should be attended with with so great delay on their part, after being consented to by Congress—I suspect indeed that concession has a little embarrassed them— they had probably been led to beleive that their request would not be complied with, and were determined on War, and tho that is an event some of the Nations, particularly the Wyandots, and part of the Delawares would wish to prevent, it is certainly ardently desired by many others; and I am far from being sanguine in the hope that the Commissioners will have it in their power to prevent it. The Western tribes have been so successful in their depredations on the Ohio River—their settlements are so distant, and their country so difficult, they imagine themselves perfectly safe; and as by these incursions they gratify at once their passions of avarice and revenge, and their desire for spiritous liquors, every boat carrying more or less of that commodity, few of them may be expected to attend; nor are they to be much depended on should they attend generally;-at this time however even a hollow peace, if better cannot be secured, is very much to be wished. The confusion that seems to prevail amongst the different tribes, might possibly be improved into a rupture, if the United States had proper persons amongst them, or that any of the Nations had much confidence in us, but neither of these is the case, nor do I think it ever will be the case.—Our settlements are extending themselves so fast on every quarter where they can be extended—Our pretentions to the country they inhabit has been made known to them in so unequivocal a manner, and the consequences are so certain and so dreadful to them, that there is little probability of there ever being any cordiality between us—The idea of being ultimately obliged to abandon their country rankles in their minds, and our British Neighbours at the same time that they deny the cession of Country made by them, suffer them not to forget for a moment the claim that is founded upon it. - Any Opportunity that may present itself either to sow the seeds of discord among them, or to cultivate a good understanding with them will be embraced, if it can be done without committing the United States.—There is another reason why the Indians have been so tardy and undecided about their meeting which has been supplied by the Government of New-York—It may not be very proper for me to animadvert on the conduct of that or any Government; but it surely was very improper to call the six Nations to a meeting in that State,” and as I have understood for State purposes at the very time they had been called to a different part of the country for general purposes, and in which that State as a member of the Union was equally concerned, and no meeting is of much consequence without these nationſs].-It has distracted them very much—they complain of it and say “they are called here and they are called there—One says here is the great Council Fire and to this you must come—another tells them there is the great Council Fire and there they must go, and a third tells them it is lighted up in a third place (that I understand is the land company that has been formed in that State to take leases of them) and they know not which to do, or whom to beleive, they feel themselves like drunken Men reeling from side to side and unable to fix themselves any where.” and as they are naturally I had like to have said, not altogether unjustly, jealous of us, it has at this time encreased that natural jealousy. It seems however they are now on their way, and may be expected ere long. I have had the Provisions at the place appointed for a considerable time with a small party to take care of them, and a person to speak with any parties that might arrive; but these encrease the expences. Tomorrow I shall set out myself but shall not go farther than the Muskingum settlement until the six Nations arrive, and shall take every opportunity to inform you of every occurrence—But I cannot conclude this without expressing a wish that we were better prepared against hostilities which it is the general sentiment will certainly happen, and which tho' I do not think them inevitable, are but too likely to take place I have the honor to be &c On the Messengers letter The Account of M" Purviance being put to Death is contradicted by a Mº Mitchel who was taken the same day and has obtained his liberty and arrived at this place a few days ago.

THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS 
SUPPLEMENT TO THE LAND ORDINANCE OF 1785  [July 9, 1788) A supplement to an ordinance entitled An Ordinance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of lands in the Western territory.” Whereas it is found to be inconvenient to execute that part of the land ordinance passed May 20" 1785* which directs that certain proportions of lands be allotted to the several states to be sold by the loan officers in each state: And whereas a sufficient quantity of lands for satisfying the bounties due to the late Army was set apart by the Act of Congress passed the 22" of Oct. last,” whereby further drafts for satisfying military bounties in lands from the townships lately surveyed are become unnecessary, Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled, That so much of the said ordinance passed May the 20" 1785, as ordains that certain parts of the townships therein directed to be surveyed shall be drawn for in the name of the Thirteen States respectively, according to the quotas in the last preceding requisitions in all the States, in order that the same be sold by the said loan officers; and also that the Secretary at War shall take by lot from the townships when surveyed certain proportions of land for the use of the late Army, so far as the same may respect future drafts, be, and the same are hereby repealed. Be it further ordained, That the board of treasury be, and they hereby are authorised and directed to sell those parts of the seven ranges of townships surveyed in the western territory which are not already sold or drawn for the use of the late army in the same manner, on the same conditions, and under the same restrictions and limitations as were prescribed in the resolutions of Congress of April 21" 1787, ” except as to the place of sale & the daily continuance thereof, which may be So far varied, that the said board may commence the sales at New York or Philadelphia, and adjourn the same from time to time, to any part or parts of the United States which they may judge most proper for the purpose. Be it further ordained, That the Secretary at War issue warrants for bounties of land to the several officers and soldiers of the late continental Army who may beentitled to such bounties or to their respective assigns or legal representatives, certifying therein the rank or station of each officer, and the line, regiment corps and company in which the officer or soldier served. Be it further ordained, That the Geographer by warrant under his hand and seal appoint one surveyor to each of the two tracts or districts of land set apart for satisfying the said bounties by the Act of Congress of the 22° of October last; and that the persons entitled to lands by virtue of warrants issued as aforesaid, shall be at liberty to locate them on any part of the two tracts of lands set apart as aforesaid, provided that each location and survey shall be bounded on one side by one of the external boundaries of one of the tracts aforesaid, or by some prior survey therein, and the external lines of each survey shall run east and west, north and south, such parts thereof excepted as may border upon a river bounding the district and the several surveys shall be in squares, unless where restrained by such river or by the lines of former surveys; and provided also that in every location there shall be a combination of as many warrants as shall make the same at least six miles square, and no interstices shall be left between surveys less than six miles wide. Be it further ordained That each surveyor upon making any survey shall protract and lay the same down in a general map to be kept and preserved & shall make a record of each survey in a book to be kept for that purpose & make out and deliver a copy of the survey certified under his hand to the proprietor or proprietors thereof; and the surveyor shall retain in his hands all warrants by him laid out and located until he can transmit the same to the board of treasury which he shall do within one year after laying out the land, certifying thereon under his hand that the same is satisfied. That the surveyors to beappointed as herein before directed shall be entitled to receive for the services enjoined them by this Ordinance so much only as shall be allowed and fixed by the governor and judges of the western territory & shall be liable to be displaced by the geographer for neglect of duty or other misbehaviour in which case he shall supply any vacancy so happening by a new appointment. That each surveyor who may be appointed under this Ordinance, before he enters upon the duties of his office shall take an oath or affirmation, that he will justly and truly execute the trust reposed in him as Surveyor of a district of land in the western territory according to the best of his skill and understanding without favor or partiality which oath or affirmation shall be taken before the Governor or either of the Judges of the western territory, or one of the Justices of the Supreme Court in any of the United States, and being duly attested, shall be transmitted to the Secretary of Congress to be by him filed of record. That the maps and records before mentioned shall at all times be subject to the orders of Congress, to be removed or deposited wherever they shall direct. That if any officer or soldier, or assignee or grantee of either shall desire to have their bounty of land allotted in the townships or fractional parts thereof, lately drawn for the army by the Secretary at War, out of the first four ranges of townships surveyed west of the Ohio, and shall cause such his desire in writing, together with his land warrant to be deposited in the office of the Secretary at War before the first of July 1789, the said Secretary shall cause so much of the said Townships which have been drawn for the Army, to be drawn for by lot as will satisfy the warrants so deposited, for which surveys shall be made out and delivered to the several proprietors, signed by the Geographer of the United States, which surveys shall be recorded in a book by the Geographer and lodged in the Treasury Office. And whereas lands are set apart for satisfying military bounties not only in the said districts and townships but also within the limits of purchases made by several companies, Be it further ordained, That the persons who have purchased tracts of the federal lands shall have credit for so much land as the warrants, issued as aforesaid and delivered by them to the board of treasury, cover, provided that in no case deductions on account of military bounties shall exceed one seventh part of the purchase. Done in Congress &c 
REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TREASURY: THE MEMORIAL OF JUDGES PARSONS AND WARNUM  [July 9, 1788) The Board of Treasury to whom was referred a Memorial of Samuel H. Parsons, and J. M. Varnum Judges of the Western Territory. Beg leave to Report That the object of the Memorialists is to obtain the authority of Congress, for charging their Salaries as Judges, from the time of their appointment instead of the period of taking the Oath of Office: That the reasons assigned for this application are annexed to the accounts of the Memorialists, Copies of which are herewith transmitted— On the above Memorial the Board beg leave to observe, That, it is the general Rule of the Treasury to compute the Salaries of Public Officers, from the time of their taking the Oaths of Office; except in cases where, the Claimants can prove, that they have been actually employed in the Public Service, previous to such period, and have been prevented by some peculiar circumstances from taking the requisite Oaths. That on the reasons offered by the Memorialists, being submitted together with their respective accounts to the examining Officers of the Treasury—they have reported; that the Governor of the said Territory, is the person best qualified for determining when the Judges began to execute the Duties of their respective Offices; at which period the Act for their appointment declares that their Salary should COImmence. In this opinion, the Board concur; as a precedent may be otherwise established, which will render it altogether Indeterminate at what period the Salaries of Persons holding Offices under Congress should COmmence. The Memorialists will at present be entitled to receive their Salaries as other Officers of the Civil Department, from the time of their taking the Oaths of Office; which, appears to have been on the 4" of April last; and should it hereafter appear equitable that an extra allowance should be made for the Services stated to have been performed by them previous to the period of taking the Oaths; the United States will without doubt make such compensation as shall appear adequate, on the proper proofs being exhibited of the propriety of such claim.— - All which is humbly submitted.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  FORT HARMAR July 13" 1788. SIR/ In the letter I did myself the honor to write on the 5" instant” from Fort Pitt I mentioned that the provisions intended for the Indians at the intended treaty had been sent to the place upon the Muskingham where the meeting was appointed, and that General Harmar had furnished a small party to take care of them—This day George Washington a Delaware arrived here express from the officer who commands the party with an account that the morning before he had been attacked by a party of Indians—that he had one man killed, two badly wounded and several missing—those missing he concluded to be either made prisoners, or attempting to make their way to this post—one of them is since come in—A negro servant of Mº Duncans was also killed and scalped. The Indians were repulsed and one of them left dead on the spot; their attack however was a very spirited one, for they rushed between the guard and some Hutts that had been thrown up to cover the Men and provisions, armed with Spears chiefly; Nine Delawares with their women and children came to the party about two hours after the attack, they expressed the greatest concern at the affair—protested their being utterly ignorant of it, and said the dead Indian was a Tawa,” which is not improbable as it seems the party had come down the Muskingham in bark Canoes some of which were found not far above the post. It is impossible to determine whether this affair has been the mere wanton act of some predatory party uncountenanced by the Nation they belong to—whether it may have been committed by direction of the Nation to embarrass the Councils and obstruct a general peace to which it is said that Nation are much opposed—or whether it ought to be considered as an Act of general hostility—In any of these cases however I judged it improper to let the provisions remain where they were any longer—Should the Nations be resolved on War and this be the first effect of that resolution it will be soon followed by others of a more serious nature—In this uncertainty to have desired the party to be strengthned I thought would be improper and what General Harmar might well refuse—to let the provisions remain with the present guard might be throwing both into the hands of the Savages—after such an insult to meet the Indians at that place should they be inclined to come I thought inconsistent with the dignity of the United States—Taking all circumstances into view and not depending all together upon my own opinion, tho' alone responsible, with the advice of Judge Parsons and Judge Varnum and General Putnam I sent some boats up to bring the provisions away and requested General Harmar to withdraw the party—in a few days the whole will be here. In order however that I might be able in some degree to develop the intentions of the Savages, and to give them an opportunity to offer some satisfaction if they were inclined to do it I have sent a speech " to the Chiefs of all the Nations that are now met in Council at the Detroit or at the Tawa river (I am not certain which of the places) accompanied by one to the Wyandots at Sanduskie, copies of which are enclosed. If they mean to be at Peace with the United States they will at least make an apology for what has happened—should they be hesitating or divided, then something like a threat, at the same time a desire for peace [if) is declared, may encrease the division—If War is actually determined on it can do no harm, and even in that case may do some good—the Message will probably draw forth a reply; that may produce another from me—perhaps another from them again and some time will be gained—Should they disavow the act and offer any reparation consistent with the honor of the United States, and that not strained very high, for I am well aware how embarrassing a War would be, and how ruinous to the frontier people, I shall certainly accept it, and invite them either to this place or any other of the posts they may prefer; but this affair has so much shaken my opinion of their regard to national Faith, I should not be over fond to meet them quite unprotected, which it was my intention to have done. I hope Sir Congress may not think the Ton of my Message too high—to remonstrate was become absolutely necessary, and then I thought it best to remonstrate against the whole of their improper conduct than a part only, and to do it in such terms as I thought might make some impression upon them. I have the honor to be &c. (Signed) A* Sº CLAIR. THE HON” GEN' KNOX.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE INDIANS IN COUNCIL [July 13, 1788) To the Chiefs of all the Nations assembled either at the Tawa River or at the Mouth of the Detroit River. Brothers You must well remember with how much earnestness you last summer requested that Congress would listen to your requests, and send some persons to meet you in Council, in order that the causes of them might be removed. You know how readily Congress complied with your request, and that I was one of the persons appointed to meet you. You are not ignorant that the Council Fire has been long kindled at the Falls of Muskingham; which place was chosen as being the most convenient to you and to us, but principally with a view to your convenience. The appointed time is past more than three Months, and I have been waiting with impatience to hear of your arrival, but as yet I know not whether you intend to come You have detained the Messengers sent to you, and have sent none to us in return, so that we know nothing of your minds:–Whether you are desirous of Peace as you professed yourselves to be when you applied for a Treaty, or whether you intend to go to War, as many circumstances would induce us to believe. Judge now yourselves! Would you be pleased with such conduct in any nation whatever? No you would not be pleased; neither can you expect that the United States should be pleased with it in you— But this is not all. It is not the disrespect which you have shewn that occasions this Message, but actual and unprovoked Hostility. The Citizens of the United States have been plundered and made Prisoners, and killed upon the Ohio River peaceably following in confidence of Treaties, their lawful business.-The Flag of the United States has been fired upon; and (what is perfidious beyond comparison) when a small party of Soldiers were sent to watch the Council Fire, kindled at your request;-to build a Council House for you to meet in; and to take care of the provisions sent there to feed you, you have fallen upon them, and killed them. Answer me, Should these things be? In the name of the United States I require an immediate explanation of these transactions, and demand satisfaction and the restitution of the Prisoners—Until these are made, as there can be no confidence it will be improper we should meet one another in Council. I had indeed hoped to accomplish a great and good work—to have planted the Tree of Peace—to have brought all the Nations to have watered its Roots with us and sat together under its shade—to have removed all causes of complaint on both sides, and that having sprung from the same Earth to have infused the same spirit, and have but one heart and one mind. Brothers The United States are sincerely desirous of Peace, but if you will have War, why you shall have War. I will wait some time at this place and expect soon to have an answer.

It may yet blow over, and that it may, I have sent a Speech to the Chiefs of all the Nations that are assembled at the Mouth of the Detroit or of the Tawa River; I am not sure at which place they now are, but at which ever they be, I desire that you may send it there.—It concerns both you and us to do good; and the Nations have chosen that our Messages should go through your hands—therefore be strong, and this Speech forward, and assist in removing the Cloud that at present obstructs us.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  FORT HARMAR July 16" 1788. SIR/. I had the pleasure to receive this morning your letters of the 3** and 4* * instant together with the additional Instructions of Congress on the subject of the Indian Treaty.” From mine to you of the 13* instant * (a duplicate of which, with the Messages sent to the Indians is enclosed) you will find that business has at present rather an unfavorable aspect: I am not however without hopes that it may be brought to issue in peace, being persuaded that it is the wish of the Nations which from their situation can dous most harm, at the same time that they are most acceptable to us. I think Sir a good deal of time may elapse before the great event of peace or War is decided upon; so long at least as that I may be fully informed of the sentiments of Congress upon what has happened, and whether the steps I have taken meet their approbation.—Embarrassing as an Indian War would be, I would wish from that motive, if there were no others, to take every proper mean to prevent it; but it is with Nations as with Individuals, the tamely submitting to one injury usually invites a greater, and where the national honor or interest is concerned I beleive some embarrassments ought to be overlooked so far however as I am the depository of either, I conceive I should be highly culpable not to maintain and defend them, unless I had express orders to the contrary, and that the lines of departure were pretty distinctly marked. I am very sensibly affected Sir by this fresh mark of the confidence of Congress in trusting to my disposal the further sum of twenty thousand dollars—I may venture to assure you that not one penny of it will be called for unless the objects in view can be attained; but it would be wrong in me, whilst the contrary is my opinion, and I believe not ill grounded, to let an expectation that they will be attained gain ground. The West line pointed out in the original instructions * which I was at liberty to stipulate for as a boundary, would not I believe be agreed to without much difficulty, because between that line, the Ohio and Mississippi the principal hunting grounds are contained and it is the residence of some of the Nations not very well disposed towards the United States; when I say the principal hunting grounds I mean those that abound in Deer, the species of game the most essential to the Indians—To extend the boundary northward to the completion of the forty first degree would include the whole of it, as well as a great part of the Country where the Wyandots reside, and what was reserved to the Shawanese and Delawares; now Sir there is not the least probability that these Countries will be given up at this time, for any consideration that can be offered—And I believe that if contrary to my expectations they should consent to make formal conveyances of that country, unless they are determined to abandon it altogether which is not likely, they will never consider themselves as bound by them, so that instead of establishing a solid and permanent peace, a foundation may probably be laid for irreconcilable hatred and wasting Wars and the money be thrown away into the Bargain—These are my opinions— I offer with great defference, but I hold my duty to offer them, and notwithstanding, I will leave nothing undone within my power to accomplish the wishes of Congress. I have also enclosed Copies of letters from Wilson the Messenger” and Khuna Wyandot Chief" to Col” W* Butler transmitted to me by Gen' Butler and received since I sat down to write—Khun seems well disposed and I have reason to think that Tribe is generally so—The half King who is now dead was the greatest enemy we had amongst them. As the Post is now established to Pittsburgh the communication from this part of the Country will be easier, and I shall not fail to give you information of every thing that turns up by every opportunity from hence.” I have the Honor to be &c (Signed) A*S*CLAIR.

INHABITANTS ON THE MUSKINGUM TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  [July 16, 1788] May it please your Excellency! The condesending and affectionate manner, in which you have been pleased to make known the constitutional government of the Western Teritory, and your own appointment, as Governer and Commander therein, demands our most grateful acknowlegements. The infant state of our settlement, in this pleasent, tho’ uncultivated country, can exhibit nothing to your Excellency, worthy your attention, but the sincerest attachment, and the fair prospect of rising to happiness and greatness, under a wise administration, to be conducted by the best of men. When thus far removed from the country, that gave us birth, from our friends and from the influence of the government of any state, we esteem it one of the greatest blessings, that we can have civil government established among us, which is the only foundation for the enjoyment of life, of liberty and of property. And we also feel a particular satisfaction, in having a Gentleman of your Excellency's distinguished character, in the administration thereof, to whom we have confidence to look as to a patron, a father and a friend. As we are contious of the benifits, that must result to this Teritory, from a government thus early established, when administered by your Excellency: we shall date the Era of our civil happiness, from the joyful day on which it was established. Your Excellency may rely, that those, who are influential in promoting this settlement, will use every effort in establishing peace and good order in this Teritory; and are happy, that your Excellency entertains such an opinion of them. We also derive equal satisfaction with your Excellency, in having our judicial officers, Gentlemen, not only commanding respect, but also such as have attained our highest confidence and esteem. - We are fully satisfied with the system of our temporary government: and while Gentlement of the abilities and rectitude of your Excellency and their honours the Judges promulgate our laws; we promise ourselves, not with a flattering hope, but with a sure expectation, that we shall be governed by laws, mild in their operation yet efficient to their purposes; such as are founded in wisdom and justice. The taske is truly arduous and the undertaking great, to come to so remote a country as this, to reduce forests to proper cultivation and to rear towns and cities in places explored only by natives and wild beasts: but if we persevere as we have begun, we have but little to fear; as we are favoured with every blessing that Nature can give, under the auspicies of a good government. We wish to live on the most perfect terms of friendship with all the nations of the world. We have endeavoured to sow the seeds of peace and harmony, in the breasts of the natives. We have treated them like friends, like brothers, and your Excellency's well timed advice has strengthened our resolution, to lead them, if possible, by mild and gentle means, to Civilization, Virtue and Happiness. We regret that your Excellency and also the Judges must be often absent from this settlement; as we think your presence would add both to our prosperity and happiness. But we at the same time rejoice that you will also be freequently here. May the Governer of the Universe long continue your Excellency in your present station! May your Excellency have the satisfaction of seeing the people of this Teritory, influenced by your precepts & example, become a people volentarily subjected to government and of uniforme regularity, among whom peace and justice, uninimity and friendship will ever delight to dwell! May we here find a safe, a peaceful and happy retreat; after the toils of a calamatous war! May we enjoy the richest fruits of a glorious revolution! And when States shall rise upon the principles of a well regulated colonial government, may your Excellency still be revered as the first of all the citizens!

KNOX. GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  FORT HARMAR July 22" 1788 SIR/ Since mine of the 16* * the party which was at the Falls of Muskingham have returned to this place and brought the provisions with them. A party of Chippawas came into that Station in a day or two after the affair there—their behaviour gave the Officer reason to believe that they had ill intentions—and both him, and Mº Duncan (the person who furnished the provision and who was there for the delivery of it) were of opinion that they had been engaged in the outrage; and were possitive as to one of them, who they actually saw kill one of the Soldiers, he therefore thought it proper to make them prisoners; they are now here six in number, and in close confinement. Another circumstance which corroborated the opinion of their having been concerned was one of the Soldiers Cartridge Boxes having been found in their possession—when questioned about it, they prevaricated—A Woman of theirs pretended to have found it in the woods and appealed to a Delaware who, she said, was with her when she found it—the Delaware Woman contradicted her—“She had indeed been with her in the woods, but not when she found the Cartridge Box.” There is no further intelligence from the Indian Country—it will yet be six or eight days before my Messenger will return but I have some reason to expect the Pipe” with a number of Delawares sooner— should they bring any thing worthy of communicating I will write you immediately.

JUDGE PARSONS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  MARIETTA 31* July 1788 SIR I was honored with your Letter, this Morning" informing me that some People in this City, had already fallen into the practice of Selling Spirituous Liquor to Indians, as had been reported to your Excellency—early in June some people from Virginia occasioned Trouble in this Settlement by improper Conduct towards the Indians when here: sold them Spirits & otherwise misbehaved, upon which a temporary Regulation was made here, until your Excellency should arrive & give other Orders on the Subject, strictly forbiding all Traffic with the Indians, but under the Licence of General Harmer or of the Board of police—I know of no Instance in which that Order has been violated, and on the strictest Inquiry I have been able to make I have not the least Reason to apprehend that Spirituous Liquors have been sold to Indians by any person within this Settlement—Col. Crary and Cap" Knowles are the only Persons within my Knowledge who reside here & have Liquors of any kind to sell, in Respect to Col. Crary I am very sure he never has in a single Instance sold Liquors to Indians, and Cp* Knowles so far from selling them any, I am informed he will neither sell nor give to them—I certainly would comply with your Excelleny's Desire on this Subject could I find any person to whom a Caution should be given. I beleive your Excellency has been misinformed, perhaps from sinister Views; I fully agree in your Opinion of the Necessity of preventing such practices & am ready to concur in any proper Measures to effect it. but is not your Excellency's Authority as Superintendant of Indian Affairs fully competent to this Business, all Commerce with Indians being forbidden but under your permission I am with great Respect & Esteem your Excellency's Obed" Serv" SAM H.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR, FORT HARMAR, August 17°th 1788. SIR. After so long a silence as from the 22'nd " of last month, and when events of great moment are ripening I am sorry to have nothing of consequence to communicate—I then mentioned my expectations that the messenger I had sent with the remonstrance to the Indians would return in six days—He did return within a day or two of that time and brought from the Delawares and Wyandots the enclosed speech, N° 1,” which is nothing to the purpose, and to which I returned the Answer N* 2° to the Pipe, thro' whom their speech came—In a few days after, the Pipe and several Wyandots amongst whom were a son of the late half-king and another young Chief came in here and delivered in Council (for every thing is done with these people seriatim) the paper marked Nº. 3,” to which I returned the answer N° 4 *— Next day the Pipe addressed me on the subject of the Chippewas who are in confinement here, endeavoring to exculpate them, and throwing all the blame upon those who had escaped for what had happened at the falls; to which I returned him an answer in writing N° 5*—In reply he acknowledged that we had reason for suspecting them, and did not, nor could not blame us for confining them—still it was the Tawas that did the mischief and they had escaped—These were Chippewas and had nothing to do with it, and requested they might be released—That was flatly refused him—After some time he represented that the two men who had escaped would make very false representations—that they had actually done so having reported that these four who were here were put to death before they ran away, which was the reason they did it—That if one of them, if I would not release the whole could be given to him he would carry him to the meeting at the Detroit—confront him with the others, and endeavor to remove any ill impressions their reports might have made—Under the appearance of much concern for and zeal to serve the interest of the United States, which in his way he mixed with the proposition, I thought I could discover some fears he had of the resentment of the nations these people belong to against his own people, For the Delawares were present when they were laid hold of, and were dismissed by Mr M*Dowell, the officer, in a very friendly manner—I declined giving him an answer at that time but told him I would consider of it— Two days after, I sent for him, [and said] that out of consideration for him I had agreed to his proposal, and with some ceremony delivered him a Chippewa Man about fifty years of age by appearance—He engaged to take [him] to the Detroit, and to bring him back here—It appeared to me that no ill consequence could flow from gratifying him—that some good ones possibly might, and that at any rate the man was of very little consequence. I have been very anxious for an answer to the message sent to the nations at the Detroit on the 13’th ultimo,” but as it was the 24'th before it left Sandusky, and the six nations were not arrived ten days ago (at least their arrival had not been heard of at Sandusky at that time) and the other nations will probably do nothing with it, without them, it may be some time yet before it will reach us, for I do not think they will decide upon their answer very hastily. There has been a great many Indians here lately, chiefly Wyandots and Shawanoese, and two or three Senecas, but except the Pipe and two Wyandots none of their principal men, most of whom they say are gone to their council at the Detroit— Yesterday a White man of the name of Zane" who was taken prisoner when young, and has lived with the Wyandots for many years came here with his whole family—He intends to quit, I believe the savage life and returning to his friends in Virginia who are respectable—One of his brothers lives upon the Ohio at Wheeling,” and was a member of the late Convention of that State. Whether this resolution proceeds from disgust, or from an apprehension of danger that he would rather shun I have not yet been able to learn—he appears however, to be a decent sensible man, with much less of the savage manners than might have been expected after a residence amongst them of more than twenty years—He says [that] the reports are, for he mentions nothing as of his own knowledge, that the western nations are now all at peace, and that the Shawanoese have also laid down the Tomahawk—that very great numbers of them are expected at the Detroit, which makes the Wyandots uneasy who live there, and are comparatively a civilized people—The loss of all their horses, cattle, and dogs they look upon as the certain consequence; as upon all these they feed indiscriminately—I sounded him about the sentiments of the Indians he had fallen in with in regard to the objects of the expected treaty—He says, when sober, they generally talk of peace, but even with him they are guarded, but when intoxicated it is their general talk that they will maintain the lands on the NorthWest side of the Ohio– that the river shall be the boundary between us—that as they were compelled to sign the treaty at the Miami, the Commissioners shall be compelled to sign what they please at this, and should they refuse they will go to war immediately, and go to the treaty prepared for the alternative— I have letters from the messengers, Wilson and Rinkin of the 19'th, and from Rinkin of the 20'th of July, copies of which I have enclosed— Every thing is yet in a state of great uncertainty, and will not clear up until the six nations get to the Council at Detroit—Then I may have some reply from the assembled nations that will let some light in upon it—But Sir, should it take an unfavorable turn, the consequences will be fatal to the frontier countries, and even the posts that are occupied by the United States aſll] along the Ohio would not be very safe—Not that the Indians could make any impression upon them, but the water communication would be cut off, [as] the Contractors depend so much upon it, that they never have any stock before hand, but feed them from hand to mouth—Pardon this hint it is out of my way to be sure, but it came across me, and I could not suppress it. In consequence of General Butler's letter of the 3" of August " I applied to General Harmar for some protection for the senecas that were expected—None could be afforded from this post, but as Captain Zeigler was every moment expected at Fort Pitt with a company the General was obliging enough to send orders for his halting there for them, and taking them under his protection until he arrived here—At the same time I sent directions to prevent their leaving Pittsburgh before Captain Zeigler's arrival—I do hope the people along the river will not be mad enough to molest them on their passage, at the same time I own I fear they will if they are not restrained by seeing them under the escort of the Continental troops—General Butler's application will not have any good effect should Mº Zane communicate it, which I think he will not; I believe it would have a contrary one to what he expected and desired.

The other six payments to be made half yearly with Interest from the time in which the survey is returned. On making the first payment entrys shall be permitted on so much land as that sum is equal to at the limited price. On making the second payment a deed shall issue for so much land as may then be paid for, and other deeds if required shall issue on making the several payments: Provided that it is previously stipulated on what part the first deed shall be laid, and that every subsequent deed shall be for a regular tract as nearly as may be of an equal width extending from the Mississippi to the eastern boundary of the general purchase, and that the several deeds be for tracts in contact with one another. That in case of failure in any one of the payments stipulated for, the contract shall be considered as forfeited in all the parts thereof, which shall then remain to be carried into effect. That instead of the three parallelograms to be reserved according to the Act of 20° June last for donations to the antient settlers on the west side of a certain ridge of rocks, there shall be reserved an equal quantity of land for the same use to be laid out in three squares on the east side of the said ridge of rocks, and as near as may be to the improvements belonging to the Villages of Kaskaskies, la Praire du Rochers & Kahokia”— That in case there are any improvements belonging to the antient french settlers without the general reserved limits, the same shall also be considered as reserved for them in the sale now proposed to be made"—

That the Governor of the western territory cause to be laid out at the public expence in the form of a square adjoining to the present improvements at Post S" Vincents and in whatever direction the settlers shall prefer, a tract of land sufficient for compleating the above donations; which tract shall afterwards be divided by lot among the settlers who are entitled to any part of the same, in such manner as they shall agree.*— 
INSTRUCTIONS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  [August 29, 1788) On a report of the same Committee [Mr. Williamson, Mr. Dane, Mr. Clark, Mr. Tucker, and Baldwin] the following Instructions to the Governor of the western territory were agreed to *— SIR-You are to proceed without delay, except while You are necessarily detained by the treaty now on hands,” to the french settlements on the River Mississippi, in order to give dispatch to the several measures which are to be taken according to the Acts of 20th June last 8" and the 28" Instant.” of which a copy is enclosed for Your Information. You are to enquire whether there be any Indians who claim the lands on the east side of the river Mississippi, above the mouth of the Ohio–And if there be any such Indians, You are immediately to take measures for holding a treaty with them, and extinguishing their claim at least to so much of the territory as You find described in the aforesaid Acts, and in the several Acts of Oct: 22" 1787 relative to lands on the Mississippi.” If You find it cheapest and best to extinguish the claim of those Indians by agreeing to furnish them annually with a certain allowance in corn, or other provisions for a term not exceeding ten Years, You will contract accordingly— When You have examined the titles and possessions of the settlers on the Mississippi in which they are to be confirmed, and given directions for laying out the several squares, which the settlers may divide as they shall think best among themselves by lot, You are to report the whole of your proceedings to Congress”— After You shall have dispatched the several matters committed to your care on the Mississippi, You will take Post Sº Vincents on Your return, where You are to pursue the measures directed to be taken by the Act of this day,” and report your proceedings accordingly.—

That a Supplement to an Ordinance,” lately published, has made the Directors of the Brethrens Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen very desirous, that the granted Lands may be surveyed as soon as possible, being apprehensive of Difficulties, on Account of their being surrounded by the District appointed in October last for the Officers of the late Army, and being sensible that a Survey of the Gift to the Society in Trust for the Christian Indians will greatly facilitate the Location of the Warrants granted to the Officers. That at a Consultation with the Geographer, it was found almost impracticable, on Account of the Courses of the River Muskingum, to bring the said three Towns into One regular Tract, without enlarging it to near three times the Quantity of Land granted to the Society, and that the beneficent Intention of the Honorable the Congress could not be accomplished, without the said Lands being laid out in two or three different Tracts. That the Society sensible of the Increase of the Expence in Surveying the said Land in different Tracts, will chearfully bear such a proportionable Part of the Expences as the said Increase may amount to, and willingly advance the Expences in hopes of being reimbursed at a future day. That upon Application to the Geographer, that the said Lands, if possible, may be surveyed this Fall, he answered in Writing: “I am well convinced of the Practicability of my being able to return Platts of the Survey into the Treasury Office, before the Commencement of the ensuing Year, and that without interfering with the Bussiness I am now on my Way to execute”. Now Your Petitioner most humbly prays in the Name of the said Society, That Your Excellency will be pleased to order Thomas Hutchins, Esquire, the Geographer, to have the above mentioned reserved and granted Lands, surveyed without Loss of Time in two or three different Tracts, as the said Geographer shall find convenient for the Society. And Your Petitioner further prays that in the Sale of the intermediate Spaces or Tracts, between the Lands so to be laid out, the Society may have the Preference, they paying for the same at the Rate at which such Lands are granted to others. And Your Petitioner as in Duty bound, shall ever pray JOHN ETTWEIN BETHLEHEM August 29. 1788.  N. 22 To His Excellency Cyrus Griffin Esq.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE: MEMORIAL FROM WINCENNES AND THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY  [September 1788] The Come consisting of Mr Clark Mº Williamson & Mr Madison to whom were referred the memorial of Mº Tardiveau.” Agent of the French and American Inhabitants of the Illinois and Post Sº Vincents, report, that in and by the Ordinance for the Government of the Western territory passed the 13" day of July 1787, it is ordained that, “There shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary Servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of Crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,[”] And Whereas since the passing of said Ordinance it appears there were at that time Negroes under Servitude to the inhabitants then residing at Kaskaskias Illinois Post St Vincents and other of the Antient French Settlements whose Right to the property they possessed were guaranteed by Congress in their Act Accepting the Cession of Claim to Western territory made by the State of Virginia; which Right of property it was not the intention of Congress to violate by said Ordinance but merely to restrain the Settlers in future from carrying persons under Servitude into the Western territory, for remedy whereof; Resolved, That the before mentioned Ordinance for the government of the Western territory, shall not be construed to deprive the Inhabitants of Kaskaskias Illinois Post St Vincents and the other Villages formerly settled by the French & Canadians, of their Right and property in Negro or other Slaves which they were possessed of at the time of passing the said Ordinance, or in any manner to manumit or Set free any such Negroes or other persons under Servitude within any part of sº Western territory; any thing in the said Ordinance, to the contrary notwithstand- Ing.— And Whereas Congress by their Act of the 20" of June * and 29* of August” last, took measures for confirming in their possessions and Titles all the French and Canadian Inhabitants and other Settlers at or near the Rivers Mississippi Illinois & Wabash, who on or before the year 1783, had professed themselves Citizens of the United States or any of them, and for laying off the several tracts which they rightfully Claim within Certain limits. And also in and by said Acts directed the laying of Certain tracts of Land of such extent as to contain four hundred acres as donations to each of the heads of families in the districts therein mentioned to be divided among them by Lot, but omitted making any grants of Land for Supporting Religion and for Schools of education as had been done in the Sale of Land in the Western territory; for Supplying which Omission, Resolved that before any of the Tracts of Land directed by the Above mentioned Acts as donations to the heads of families, shall be laid off), there shall be laid out two Tracts of Land of [blank] Acres each Adjoining to each Village not the property of any of the Inhabitants of such Village; one of which said tracts adjoining each Village shall be and Remain forever to the sole and only use of supporting the ministry of Religion in such Village, and the other of said tracts to remain in like manner for supporting Schools of education in the Village it Adjoins, any thing in the Acts of Congress of the 20" of June or 29" of August last, to the Contrary notwithstanding.

THE SECRETARY OF CONGRESS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR [LC: Force Tr., St. Clair] OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF CONGRESS, September 1* 1788. SIR, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith enclosed, an Act of the 20" of June last,” and one of the 28" of August * on the same subject. also an Act passed the 29" of August * by the United States in Congress assembled, together with instructions to you for carrying into effect certain measures which Congress have in view." To save the time of copying the Acts of the 22" of August, 1787,” referred to in your Instructions, and that I may avail myself of the post which sets off to-morrow from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, I send you enclosed the printed Journal of last year, and beg leave to inform you, that one of the acts of the 22" of October, 1787,” you will find in the appendix, page 27, 28. As you will doubtless be anxious to know the proceedings of Congress, I have also enclosed a copy of the Journal of the present year as far as printed. With great respect and regard, I have the honour to be your most obedient and humble servant, CHA. THOMSON HONOURABLE ARTHUR ST. CLAIR, Esquire. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF CONGRESS FORT HARMAR COUNTY OF WASHINGTON Sept. 2" 1788.- SIR I have been honored with your Letter of the 12" ult?" together with the Act of Congress of that day," inclosed—In consequence of that Act I have written to the Governor of Virginia and the President of Pennsylvania 7 requesting that they would give Orders to the Lieutenants of the frontier Counties to have their proportions of the Militia required, in readiness; and that on my Application to the Lieutenants they should cause them to be marched to such places as the Officer commanding the federal Troops should point out.—Should the Militia be at all necessary to protect the Inhabitants, I apprehend, the Opportunity of using them for that purpose would be lost by the delay that will attend an Application to be made to these Executives, at the distance they are from Us, after the necessity appears; for if the Indians come to the treaty, with hostile designs, they will endeavour to amuse us for some time—get whatever they can and then make their stroke suddenly, and as they may suppose unexpectedly.—but notwithstanding what has happened I do not think they are hostily inclined, at least not generally, and I still hope that Matters may be settled in an amicable Manner—These at least were my hopes & Expectations until M" Brown informed me of the Invasion and dispersion of the Cherokees by the People of Franklin *—should the northern Indians get information of that Affair, and there is little Reason to suppose they will not, I do not see how they can believe Us to be in earnest when we declare the United States are disposed to be at Peace with all the Nations—they will think that either We mean to deceive them—to lull them into a State of Security that they may become the more easy Prey; or they will despise us, as having no control over own People.—Common Prudence, (and they are mistaken who suppose they are deficient in prudence, or a knowledge of their own Interests) will lead them to decline an accommodation which might be as fatal to them as an actual and avowed War; and it is the same thing to them whether their Misfortunes arise from the natural Weakness, or relaxation of our Governments or from a want of national Faith—the Consequences are to them the same:–nor will it be possible to make them comprehend it, or believe that we speak truth when we profess to disapprove of such Transactions, or that we can possibly mean Peace in the very moment we are knocking them on the Head. Congress may well be surprised that their Resolution of the 2" of July” respecting the Treaty should have appeared in the Pittsburgh Paper of the 16" of Aug", if, as I suppose, it was put upon the secret Journal.-I have been both surprised and mortified at it—I doubt not but it will be at Detroit by the time the Indians leave it;-but I am the more mortified at the manner in which it appears, (immediatly following an extract from a Note of mine to Majº Sargeant and without any reference to any other Paper—) it leads to a belief that it has been furnished by me—I hope I will not be suspected of such Folly. I have written to the Printer to know whence he had it.—get it where he would it was great imprudence to publish it. The Government has been put in motion—a County erected by the name of Washington," Courts instituted, and the Officers necessary for the Administration of Justice appointed, and so far every thing goes well–But the Detention I have met with has prevented any Attention being paid to the Settlements on the Wabash and Missisippi where I believe it is very much wanted: so soon as the Treaty closes I shall proceed to those Countries, but the Season is so far advanced already that it appears probable our Residence for this Winter must be taken up there. I have the honor to be with great Respect Sir Your very humble Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE HON” CHARLES THOMSON Esq."

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR [LC: Force Tr., St. Clair] FORT HARMAR, Sept 2, 1788 SIR, Since mine to you of the 17* I have had the honour to receive duplicates of your Letters of July 3** and 4*,” and of August 1",” as also your favour of the 18" of that month, with their several enclosures.” I am still in the same anxious state of suspense with regard to the Indians as when I wrote last except that we have been visited repeatedly by considerable numbers chiefly, however, of the Delawares, who appear to be friendly. The only communications I have had are from the Messengers, and came to hand last night from Fort Pitt. I have enclosed the originals, not having time to take copy. It appears from them that the Six Nations, on whom the whole business seems to turn are at last arrived, so that I have reason to suspect very soon to receive information about their coming here, that will be decisive. Which shall be immediately sent forward to you. In consequence of the Resolution of the 12*,” I have this day written to the Governour of Virginia and the President of Pennsylvania,” requesting that they would give orders to the Lieutenants of the frontier Counties to hold their proportion of the Militia required, in readiness, and to march them in case it should be necessary to the places pointed out upon my application to them, which will save a good deal of time. Without an evident necessity no application will be made, and consequently no expense incurred, for I am most strongly impressed with the sentiments that a War with them, if it can be avoided would be very inconvenient, to say the least of it. General Butler and the Senecas are not yet arrived. He writes me that I may expect him by the middle of this week. From other information I believe he has been much mistaken about the number of those people. Instead of three hundred which he talked of, there will be far short of one; if these, however, are the proper persons, it is no disappointment. I have the honour to be, &c.” 
ORDINANCE FOR SURVEY OF MORAVIAN LANDS [September 3, 1788) On a report of a com" consisting of M" Clarke Mº Williamson & M" Madison " to whom was referred a memorial of John Etwein of Bethlehem, president of the brethrens society for propagating the Gospel among the Heathen.” Whereas the United States in Congress assembled by their Ordinance of the 20 May 1785 * among other things ordained that the towns of Gnaden hutten, Schoenbrun and Salem with lands adjoining to the said towns be reserved for the sole use of the Christian Indians who were formerly settled there or the remains of that society; and by an Act of the 27 July 1787 * directed the board of treasury to except & reserve out of any contract they might make pursuant to an Order of the 23 of the same month a quantity of land around and adjoining to each of the before mentioned towns amounting in the whole to 10,000 acres & ordered the property of the said towns & reserved lands to be vested in the Moravian brethren at Bethlehem in Pensylvania or the Society of the said brethren for civilizing the Indians & promoting christianity (or as they are called The society of the United brethren for propagating the Gospel among the Heathen) in trust & for the uses expressed in the said Ordinance, including others as mentioned in the said act of 27 July 1787; & whereas it has been agreed that the plot of each of the towns should be estimated at 666% acres so that each town & the reserved land adjoining shall make a tract of four thousand acres; and whereas the remnant of the said Christian Indians are desirous of returning to their towns as speedily as possible, and the United brethren to facilitate this without loss of time have offered to advance the expences of surveying the three tracts on condition they be repaid either in Money or land * Ordered That the geographer of the United States survey or cause to be surveyed as speedily as possible, without interfering with the business he is sent to execute, the three tracts of Gnaden hutten, Shoenbrun and Salem on the Muskingum including the reserved land adjoining each of the said towns and return plats thereof to the board of treasury, that deeds may be issued for the same as is mentioned above; and that he also survey or cause to be surveyed the intermediate spaces, if any there be between the said three tracts and return plats thereof with an account of the expence to the board of treas' and that the said board, provided it can be done without infringing any contract they may have already made, convey the same to the said United brethren or the society of the said brethren for propagating the Gospel among the heathen, upon their paying for the said intermediate space or spaces when the said surveys shall be returned by the Geographer, at the rate at which such lands are granted to others, and also the expences attending the surveying and plotting the said spaces, deducting the sum advanced for surveying the three tracts; provided that in case any of the abovementioned lands shall fall within the supposed bounds of the million of Acres reserved for the late Army, that the said bounds shall be understood to extend so far to the Westward as to include the million of Acres exclusive of the abovementioned lands “–

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR  FORT HARMAR COUNTY OF WASHINGTON, September 14* 1788 SIR I had the honor to address you on the second instant” since which General Butler with fifty one (Women and Children included) of the Senecas arrived here, on the 9"—amongst these the principal Persons are the Corn Planter, and the Half Town—thirty-six men in all. They say the six Nations are desirous to be at peace witn the United States. The next day after their arrival an application was made by these Chiefs, in conjunction with Cayasutha, for the releasement of the Chippeway Prisoners, in the name of their own Nation, the Cayugas, the Oneidas, and the Delawares; of the Cayugas however there is one only here, and two Oneidas; and these last tho' the application was made in the name of their Nation would not come into the Tent when it was delivered; it is altogether improbable that they could have had any directions on the subject. They were told that the whole affair had been represented to their general Council—that their request could not be complied with, and that we hoped to have no more solicitation on that head; many of the same kind had been made to me. Yesterday two Persons arrived from the Messengers—enclosed are Copies of their letter and of the Speeches of the Wyandots, delivered to them and by them—from these it appears that the Wyandots are well disposed themselves, and that was not with me a doubtful circumstance; but I suspect they will not have much influence upon the western Tribes, who notwithstanding what the Kickapoes say, I have not the least expectation to see. The other Nations will be here, but it will yet be three weeks or a Month before they arrive. One of the men (Isaac Williams,) who brought these dispatches is the son of a white woman; lives at Sandusky a sensible young Man, and has received a tolerable education, and is attached to the United States— He says that Brandt did not go with the Senecas from Niagara but that he left them there, and passed up the North side of Lake Erie, and as far as the Country of the Missassagues, and returned down the Huron and Sº Clair to Detroit, visiting the different Nations in his way.” From the letter of the Messengers it may be observed that a large Body of Indians may be expected here—that they are particular in mentioning their intention to be Armed—and that tho' they themselves have been delayed so long, by the desire of the Wyandots that they might be present at their Councils, they are not to be admitted to them; but are sent to a distance and ordered to wait the result. On these I make no comment. It is also somewhat extraordinary that the British should take this opportunity again to make presents to the Indians after having so recently made them the most considerable that ever were given, at one time *—it is also uncommon, if I am rightly informed (for the six Nations at least) to take so many of their young Men with them to Council—their numbers arrived at Detroit are stated to me at two hundred, and seventy-five, and another embarkation from Niagara expected. From all these circumstances, which certainly wear not a very favorable aspect, it may perhaps be expected by Congress that some measures should be taken by General Harmar and me, in consequence of the Resolution of Congress of the 12* of August,” for the protection of the Inhabitants at all events:–I do not however see that we can possibly do more than merely to have the Militia in readiness to act upon an emergency, and that, if the Executives of Virginia and Pennsylvania comply with my request, mentioned in my last to have been made to them, they will be. But Sir it is very little protection they will be able to afford. Defensive measures, against an enemy who allways act in small detachments, along so extended and weak a frontier, at the same time that they are as expensive (in the end often more so) than offensive operations, will always prove abortive, and the Militia of Pennsylvania and Virginia are too distant from each other to be joined; that part at least of the frontier of Virginia from which a thousand men could be drawn—offensive measures should then be resorted to, but these the state of public affairs forbid, if they can possibly be avoided:—and nothing in my power to obviate the necessity of them will be neglected. But a war with the Western tribes, at least, seems inevitable, both from the circumstance that there is no reason to expect them at the Treaty, and from the intelligence General Harmar received two days ago which as he transmits it by this opportunity, I forbear to trouble you with— a war with them will probably involve some others; and it will soon become general. In that case permit me to give you my Ideas of the most effectual manner of bringing them to their Senses. From the Falls of the Ohio to Ouiatannon is little more than one hundred and fifty Miles—from the little Miami to the Omie or Miami Town is not more than two Hundred, if my information is right, from Beaver Creek to Cayahoga is ninety; and from Post Vincennes to the Terre Haute, where the Piankeshaws reside, and to the settlements of the Kickapoos is about the same distance. Could a stroke be made at all those places, nearly about the same time, and it might be so calculated as to happen at all of them on the same day, the Indians would most likely so divide themselves as to make success at each highly probable; for you may be assured, that their general confederacy, if it exists at all, has not that efficiency which would enable the heads of it to direct its force to a point, in the security of which many of the Members would not feel themselves much interested, when each had to fear for themselves separately:—it is difficult enough among Nations who have a regular policy and strong governments, where the ideas of union and submission are familiar—with Savages it is impossible. Neither would these operations demand a very great number of Men or very considerable expense—between three and four thousand Militia, added to the troops in the service of the United States, might be sufficient and surely these might be furnished by the frontier parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and in such a manner as to be convenient to their respective destinations. The French settlements too could easily if I am well informed, give three or four hundred Men. The whole operation might I conceive if undertaken at a proper season be finished in thirty or forty days from the time they took up their march, tho' the calculation should be for a longer period. º I am sensible Sir these observations require an apology, both because I have stepped out of my line, and that they have not been so maturely considered as the importance of the object demands—they are meant only as hints of what might be done which you would not be displeased with, and as such I request you to consider them. The address of the Messengers to the Wyandots and Delawares though perhaps well enough in substance is, in my opinion highly improper in form, neither did I know they were so instructed, and General Butler assures me they were not. I should certainly have objected against an application in the name of the United States, to any Nation on Earth; much more to a few Savages, “for them to use their interest, and influence for the restoration of Prisoners,” taken in Peace too and in violation of Treaties. It may have arisen from a desire to do good, with much ignorance of the proper means, and if it would rest with those nations there would be no great harm— but if it is communicated to the British Agent which it probably will be the United States may be exposed by it. - There is intelligence which I believe may be depended upon, that the Indians at the mouth of the Wabash having been discovered, a party from Kentucky went to attack them—that missing them there, they crossed and marched to the Salines (or Salt River I believe of M" Hutchins) went up that River to its head branches, and crossed from thence to the upper part of the Riviere de l’embarras, where they fell in with and had an action with Indians, some of whom were killed—They returned by Post Vincennes and Clarkes Tract to the falls, and brought in with them Six Scalps, Seven Rifles, and twenty Horses—But whether these were the Indians that made the Stroke at the mouth of the Wabash or not does not appear.” I have the Honor to be &c (Signed) A' Sº CLAIR THE HON”* MAJOR GENERAL KNOx Secretary at War. P. S. I suppose the following numbers might suffice for all the objects mentioned above.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR [LC: Force Tr., St. Clair] FoRT HARMAR, October 7", 1788. SIR, Since I wrote to you on the 15" ultimo " I have had no manner of intelligence from the Indian council a considerable number have still been about this place but they are not persons of any consequence have not been at their towns since the Chiefs were met, and know nothing of their designs yet even they begin to be uneasy at the delay, which has nearly exhausted my patience. The last letter from the Messengers Copies of which I had the honor to transmit, rendered it probable that the Indians would soon have been here that was the 30" of August. It is morrally impossible that a number could have subsisted about the mouth of the Miami River from that time unless provisions has been sent them from Detroit they must have despersed long ago. In the daily expectation of seeing them or hearing from Wilson and Rinkin, I wore the time away until the 20" when I sent of two white men to the towns one of whom was to have returned in 12 days, but there is no account from them now it is eighteen nine days ago two Indians were sent off who were to return immediately if they met the nations on their way but that they have not done for they are not come back in short we know nothing about them and my Conjecture is that they will not allow any communication. Two days ago Cayasutha pretended to have received private intelligence that the meeting was broken up, the Western Nations having positively refused to come near us, and the Six Nations gone home. That they had left two of their chiefs, who with the Wyandots were to be here to explain matters and to desire another meeting in the Spring. If this is so, the truth of it must very soon be known, for there can be no cause for detaining the people who have been sent amongst them, but I give very little credit to it. It is a conjecture of the old man's which he puts off as intelligence I believe. I must beg pardon for troubling you with these trifling and inconclusive accounts; and indeed, I had once thought not to write any more until I could say something to the purpose, but as there must be some anxiety about both the stage and complexion of the business here, concluded it would be improper to let this opportunity pass. I have the honour, &c. MAJOR GEN" KNOX, Secretary at War. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGE PARSONS AND JUDGE WARNUM  Oct 21° 1788 GENT" In the marriage Act “I have some Objections to the first Clause—If a Limitation as to Age is necessary I should think seventeen for the Males and fourteen for the Females a period sufficiently early for tho' early marriages undoubtedly tend to the rapid encrease of the People—premature Marriages have a contrary tendency—It very rarely happens in this Climate that Girls of Twelve Years are even as animals fit for the reception of the Male, as moral Ag a family a Boy of fourteen and Girl of twelve could not be expected to discharge their duties with much propriety.” The Clause respecting Persons living out of the Territory requires alteration—perhaps in this manner “where Persons not resident within the Territory shall apply to be joined in Marriage the consent of prº shall be obtained in like manner as if they were Citizens of the Territory of the U. S.43 In the next Clause I believe it would be proper to strike out the words “to be” before solemnized, and in the after part of it instead of “is” to say “has been” solemnized.* In the Act of limitation” the prosecution of all Crimes other than Capital should be confined to two Years—Crimes of an infamous Nature is too general and indefinite a description and in strict propriety of Speech would extend to Crimes of every Species—with these alterations I shall agree to them, but it may be that I am mistaken about them and shall be glad to be set right—There was a Law agreed upon long ago for the Powers and dutys of the probate Officer,” but it never came back to me it seems necessary that Law should be published.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF CONGRESS  FORT HARMAR November 6" 1788 SIR Your favor of the first of September,” together with the Enclosures, has been in my Hands since the beginning of the last Month—that I have not acknowledged the receipt of it earlier has been owing to the expectation I was in, from day to day, that I would soon be able to mark the time when I could proceed to execute the Orders of Congress in the Country below, which were conveyed with it. from my Letters to the Secretary at War, you will have seen how those Expectations have been disapointed. The Journals you were pleased to send me arrived safe, you will please to accept my Thanks for them. By the Instructions of the 29" of August” I am directed to proceed, without delay, except while necessarily detained by the Treaty now on hand, to the french Settlements on the Mississippi. had the Treaty taken place at the time it might reasonably have been expected, I should, before now, have been in the Execution of those Instructions; but the Season is now so far advanced, and it is still so uncertain when the Indians may arrive here, that it is very doubtful whether I shall be able to go down the River before the Spring. The last Intelligence I have from the Indian Country is of the 22" ut”—they were said to be then on their way here, and I have looked, in vain, for the arrival of Wilson, a Messenger of ours, as their precursor, for above a Week”—their Motions must, however, necessarily be slow, as they have not a morsel of Provisions, and must consequently hunt their way—they were reduced to great Extremity before they broke up at the Miami It appears probable that the Business to be done with them here would not take up much time, as it is pretty certain there has not been much cordiality amongst them; but as the six Nations will, in all likelihood, winter in this part of the Country, they will draw the Negociation into as great a Length as possible, to have the better pretext for being supplied. In the proposed Treaty with the Indians who claim the Lands on the Mississippi, if there are any such, I observe it is expected they may be satisfied with an annual supply of Corn or other Provisions for a limited time—how such a Proposition may be relished by them I cannot say; but, if they are of similar dispositions to those we are better accquainted with it will not be relished at all. Goods, to a certain value, delivered to them in that way perhaps might and if the Expence be the same I see no difference, but the Sense of Congress upon this Subject may possibly be obtained before anything can be done respecting it. I very heartily congratulate you upon the Establishment of the Government, and sincerely wish and hope to see you fill a very honorable and important Station in the Administration for which no Person in my knowledge is so well qualified. With very sincere regard and esteem I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE HON” CHARLES THOMSON Esq."

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR [LC: Force Tr., St. Clair] FORT HARMAR, December 3", 1788. SIR, I had the honour to address you on the 12* ult,” and transmitted the messages and information I had received to that time, with my answers to the messages, and I promise to send forward the Messengers report by the next opportunity—that report I have not yet received, as I thought it best, the Indians having desired it, to send Wilson back with my answer. On the 24* Wilson returned and brought the enclosed speech No. 1. from the Six Nations.—That Speech obliged me to reply to the Six Nations particularly, of which No. 2. is a copy, and also to send a speech to the Nations, wherein I entered fully into the pretences they have made to be discharged from the obligation of former treaties—showed them the futility of them, and gave them a view of the consequences of peace and War to themselves. But as this is a lengthy affair, and I have been very ill with the gout, and still am so, I could not get a copy ready for this conveyance—it shall be forwarded by the next. On the first instant Wilson was again despatched with these messages, and two days after the Corn Planter sent two of his people to see what was going forward— they returned this day, and brought with them a Seneca of those who were with Brant who delivered me a message from the Wyandots and four of the Western Nations, but he could not particularise them. The purport of the Message is to let me know that they are on their way, and are got about fifteen miles on this side the Falls—that they are determined to come to the Council at this place, and desiring that we may yet have a little patience, that their hearts are good as they believe those of the Americans to be. These Indians say, that Brant, on the receipt of the Message, immediately determined to go back with his people by the way of Detroit, and had moved some miles before they set out. That from his new Encampment he had sent for the Chiefs of the Wyandots and Delawares to meet him there, but they had refused to go, telling him they were on their way to the Muskingham, and he might come to them there. This moment a messenger arrived from Wilson with the enclosed letter No. 3—Excuse me for troubling you with the original for I am not able to copy it. It disagrees with the Indian intelligence in the circumstance that the Chiefs were going to meet Brant. But Wilson had not seen either the Wyandots or Delawares, and it must have been Brant's conclusion that they would meet him. The Messenger says, that the Pipe the Chief of the Delawares and the Wyandot Chiefs whom he saw after parting with Brant told him they would not go, but would be here in four days. The Shawanese, Delawares, and Miamies said to be at hand, are the hostile tribes who live at the Miami village—Kekayuga is the name they give to that town. By the first opportunity that offers you will hear from me again, in the mean time, I am, with the greatest respect and esteem, Sir, yours, &c. THE HONOURABLE GENERAL KNOX, Secretary at War. Wilson's letter ought to bear date of the 1* instant. 
THE SECRETARY AT WAR TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR (OSL:St. Clair Papers: ALS) WAR OFFICE, December 8th 1788 SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 26th and 30° of October, and also yours of the 1* of November with its enclosures by Major Doughty “ The receipt of your several favors of the 13", 16” and 22'nd of July. the 17th of August. the 2'nd and 14'th of September, and the 7th of October,” were acknowledged from the war-Office during my absence—Having but just returned from the Eastward, and the post being to depart this day, I have not time to answer your several communications but by the next opportunity I shall particularly reply to the several objects therein stated which may require an answer. It must be a subject of great chagrin to you to find that the indians have postponed their meeting to so late a period, and that your hopes of a general treaty are so weak—Deeply impressed as you are with the evils attending an indian war at this period, you will have made use of every honorable expedient to avoid so injurious an event—and as it appears from your communications to be the wish of the officers commanding the british posts that the indians should treat with the United States, it may be hoped that the issue will yet be favorable—If you should not be able to assemble the Northern tribes now, you may be able to make a solid arrangement for assembling them and the Western indians early the next year. At present there is no Congress, whether one will assemble until the new Constitution shall take place is uncertain. If, notwithstanding your utmost exertions, an Indian war, either partial or general, should be inevitable, the best possible arrangements should be adopted for carrying it on with such vigor as speedily to terminate it—For a protracted Indian war, would be destruction to the republic, under its present circumstance—In case therefore of this event becoming certain, many reasons would concur to render your presence necessary at the seat of government.— I have the honor to be, Sir, with the highest respect & esteem Your most obedient, and Very humble Servant, H KNOX. THE HONORABLE THE GOVERNOR OF THE WESTERN TERRITORY. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS [LC: CC Papers, no. 150, vol. III, fol. 509: ALS*] FORT HARMAR Decº 13th 1788 SIR I have received Information, from Detroit, which I depend upon, that a certain Coll' Conolly, who came to that place, from Quebec, last Winter has, not long ago set out for Louisville at the rapids of the Ohio–he is the Conolly that made himself pretty remarkable during the progress of the Revolution, and was appointed a Lieut' Collonel in one of the Refugee Corps—he is upon the half pay List, and has lately obtained from Lord Dorchester an addition of two hundred pounds Sterling p" Annum, and his Expences. The Reason he assigned, at Detroit for his Journey to Louisville was that he might obtain Certificates of the value of his Property in that Country which had been confiscated * in order to support the Claim he had made upon the british Government for Compensation. My Information is, that he is sent to tamper with the People of Kentucky and induce them to throw themselves into the Arms of Great Britain, and to assure them of protection and Support in that Measure—if that cannot be brought about, to stimulate them to Hostilities against the Spaniards, and at rate to detach them from the united States.” I have written to Major Wyllis" who commands at the Rapids, informing him of those Circumstances, and requesting him to have an Eye upon him and, if he finds him either exciting a Revolt, or tempting the People to Hostilities against Spain, to make him a Prisoner, and to send him to this Post, with a transcript of the Testimony against him, and the Names of the Persons who will support it, that they may be forwarded together to You. I know of no other Officer of the united States Sir, who could with propriety take Cognizance of it; but if in that I am mistaken, you will please to inform me to whom he should be sent in case he should be apprehended. The Offence, I have no doubt is treasonable; but whether we have any Laws to punish Treason against the united States, I doubt very much—even in that Case as the Country is within the Limits of Virginia, it must be Treason against that State, and there he might be punished for it. Since his Arrival at Louisville he gives out that he has discovered some Flaw in the Act of Assembly, and means to attempt the recovery of his Estate by a Course of Law, and, as that will detain him in the Country, he has hired a House and taken up his Residence. It is certain Sir, that, in their last Convention, a proposal was made that the District of Kentucky should set up for itself, not only as independent of Virginia but of the united States also, and was rejected by a small Majority only—it may possibly be that Overtures have made to Lord Dorchester; but it cannot be that my Lord would make Conolly such an Allowance, or indeed any Allowance for looking after his property and to bring on a Claim upon his Nation. Conolly has also been writing to many People about Pittsburgh and in that Country, and has intimated an intention to visit that Place this Winter; and I have heard has opened himself pretty freely to General Morgan of Winchester in Virginia— All these Circumstances put together make it more than probable that he is an agent of the British for some sinister purpose: If any other Measures than those I have directed ought to be pursued, you will oblige me by pointing them out, and they shall be executed without delay. After the tedious Expectation that has attended the proposed Treaty with the Indians, there is now a prospect of its soon beginning, indeed in a few days, as they are now within two short days Journey— it will not however be a very general meeting, as Brant, who is also a british Pensioner at four hundred pounds Sterling pº Annum after coming within sixty Miles of Us, is gone back to Detroit, and has taken with him the whole of the Mohawks, and a part of some other Tribes of the five Nations, and it is to be feared will also prevail with the Shawanese and the western People, who were within two days Journey of him, on their way here, to return with him likewise. I do not however consider that as any great Misfortune, because I believe the consequence will be the Dissolution of the general Confederacy which he and the british have taken so much Pains to form, and hope to be able [to] keep the Frontiers of New York, Pennsylvania, and the upper part of Virginia in Peace this Winter— No Treaty I believe will secure the lower frontier of that State at present: If that, and the Possession and Sale of the western Territory is an Object with Congress they must prepare to chastise the western Nations seriously as early in the Summer as possible— The Depredations they commit upon the Inhabitants is intolerable, and it is not confined now to the Inhabitants, they have had the audacity to fall upon the Parties escorting Provisions to the Posts; and those Posts are so weak, so distant from each other, and supplied with so much difficulty that they will either fall into their Hands or be abandoned for want of Provisions, if things remain upon the Foot. It is to be feared that the Indians, at the same time, will not want for assistance from the British—and it is pretty evident that People have no thought of surrendering the Posts they hold within the Territory of the united States, for Lord Dorchester, who visited them himself this last Summer, has ordered the Town at Detroit to be picketted in, which is compleated, and additional Works to be constructed there, and a Fort they call Castle Sº Clair, on the american side of the Strait between the Lake of that Name and the Huron, which had been begun during the War, and abandoned at the Peace, to be compleated. It was always my Fear that our western Territory, instead of proving a Fund for paying the national Debt, would be a Source of Mischief and encreasing Expence—but the Expence is not the worst part of it. It has given such a Spring to the Spirit of Emigration, too high before, that tho' it is pregnant with the most serious Consequences to the Atlantic States, it cannot now be held back and the Spaniards are also trying to turn that Spirit, with great Industry to their Advantage—so that those States not only lose their People and sink the value of their Soil for the present, but are laying the foundation of the Greatness of a rival Country. It is a considerable time that the Spaniards have been offering a thousand Acres of Land gratis, to every American who would remove into west Florida—to pay him ten Dollars for every hundred weight of Tobacco he could raise and deliver at New Orleans—an exemption from all Taxes and a proportionate price for Provisions and other Articles the produce of his Farm but they have lately gone a step farther—If I am well informed, Coll' Morgan, who was lately in Treaty with the Board of Treasury for a Tract of Land on the Missisippi,” has obtained of M" Gardoqui a Grant of a very large Tract upon the spanish side opposite to the mouth of the Ohio," which he engages to settle with Americans— They are to have the same Priviledges with those who remove into Florida. He is now at Fort Pitt, and it is supposed will carry a good many People from that Country—upon Kentucky is however his chief Dependance, for in that Quarter are many Thousands of People who have been tempted by the Accounts published of its amazing fertility to quit their ancient Settlements without having secured a foot of Land there and cannot obtain Lands, but at a Price that is beyond their reach. There is no doubt many of those [who] will readily join him, for they have no Country, and indeed that Attachment to the natale Solum that has been so powerful and active a Principle in other Countries is very little felt in America. I have been casting about for some way to counteract M. Morgan and I cannot think of any so likely to succeed, as for Congress to change the mode of disposing of the western Lands in large Tracts—at least to change it for a part of them and lay them open to be taken up by People who settle upon them— The Country upon the Missisippi and between that and the Wabash, would accommodate the People of Kentucky who have no Land and I believe it would tempt them to remove to it, rather than the spanish side, and it might be disposed of in the manner the Proprietors of Pennsylvania sold the Lands they last purchased of the Indians—It was thus— The Lands were set at five Pounds Sterling p" hundred Acres—no more than three hundred Acres were allowed to be taken up by one Man”—he made a Description in writing, of the Peice he wanted, bounding it either upon Lands already granted, or some Creek or River, or marked Trees that rendered it sufficiently certain, and carried it to the Office of the Surveyor Gen' where it was entered in a Book kept for the purpose—The Surveyor General issued an order for making the Survey, returnable within a certain time to his Office and the Applicant took Possession— The purchase Money run upon Interest from the date of the order of Survey—and was discharged when it was in the Persons power tho’, to make them more industrious a time was fixed within which the Patents should be taken out but no Advantage was ever taken of their overpassing that time— On the payment of principal and interest the Patent issued— I believe there is not an instance, tho' it was a very extensive Country, at least the Instances are few, where the Patents have not been taken out, and all the Land good and bad has been sold— Altho this mode would not so suddenly extinguish any part of the Debt as that now in Use, yet an Interest equal to the Interest of the Debt as far as the Lands went, would be accruing to the united States, and the principal would come in at last, and the People, who are of infinite value, that will otherwise be worse than lost will be secured— The present Inhabitants of that Country, when they see it gathering strength by the accession of new Inhabitants will be more inclined to remain in it. The Spaniards are also at work with them to induce them to abandon it, and have succeeded with many of them. Excuse me Sir for troubling you with my Ideas on the Subject—they are crude Ideas, but you will improve upon them and perfect them, if they deserve any attention—the Subject is, in my Opinion an interesting one to the united States. The Spaniard has also been making Seizures upon the east side of the Missisippi within the Territory of the united States. General Harmar, some time ago, transmitted to the War Office, this Complaint of a Mº M*Intosh, and I now enclose you the Deposition of a Monsieur de Sº Marie on a like Occasion,” and extracts from a Letter of Major Hamtramack the Commandant at Post Sº Vincennes of the 13th of October to Gen' Harmar.” I ought Sir to beg pardon for troubling you with so long a Letter but I cannot put an end to it without requesting you to present my best Respects to M* Jay, and to believe that I Am with the greatest Respect and Esteem Sir Your most obedient Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE HONORABLE JOHN JAY Esq." Minister of foreign Affairs for the United States 15* I have mentioned Extracts from Major Hamtramack's Letter but you will find but one—the other which respects some Depredations and the Murder of some friendly Indians, has been enclosed by Gen.' Harmar in his Despatches to the SecY at War, and I have not now time to get another made out. The Treaty with the Indians is opened, and so far as we have yet gone looks well. ...  Letter from A. Sº Clair Dec. 13. 1788.*
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGE PARSONS (OSL: St. Clair Papers: C] FORT HARMAR Dec 14th 1788 SIR I have been looking over the Law for recording Deeds, and I observe that where the Grantor is dead or cannot appear, all the Witnesses or at least two must prove a Deed—This I think may be very inconvenient, for some of the Witnesses may be dead or removed out of the Territory as well as the Grantor—I believe it would be better that it should be in the power of one Witness to prove the Execution of the Deed—testifying at the same time that he saw the other Witnesses subscribe the Instrument. It seems to me altogether unnecessary that the Courts should take acknowledgments of common Deeds— it must encrease the Expense and people who come to the Sessions of the Courts will have the opportunity to find the Individual Judges who will have power to take the acknowledgments. If hereafter the Sherriff should be empowered to sell real Estates the Deeds made by him, it will be proper it should be acknowledged in open Court and become Matter of Record there. It seems also, to me to be proper that Deeds made & acknowledged out of the Territory should be confined to the same time as to the recording with Deeds made within it. As it stands Deeds made out of the Territory would be capable of being recorded at any period, and have the effect of defeating a prior bonafide purchase.” I would also wish that Mortgages might be confined to say [blank] months"—it would not in my opinion be inconsistent with the Constitution, which seems to have had in View the Cases only of absolute alienation. To the Law appointing Coroners” I have no objection—but I would wish very much that all the Laws might be transcribed on separate Paper and sufficient space left at the bottom of each page for the Subscriptions—There are some of them that are amongst the Records already that will not impress posterity with the most favorable opinion of our Accuracy. I have Objections to the Law for vesting certain Powers in the Inhabitants of towns, that I believe are insuperable. I have not time now to detail them—at any rate it is a matter that is not pressing. I am Sir ... THE HONble JUDGE PARSONS  Copy To Judge Parsons Dec. 14" 1788
VIRGINIA: ALTERATION OF CESSION ACT [Files Va. House of Delegates 99) An act concerning the Territory ceded by the Commonwealth to the United States Passed—December 30, 1788 Whereas the United States, in Congress assembled, did, on the seventh day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-six,” state certain reasons, shewing that a division of the territory which hath been ceded to the said United States, by this Commonwealth, into States, in conformity to the terms of cession,” should the same be adhered to, would be attended with many inconveniences, and did recommend a revision of the act of cession, so far as to empower Congress to make such a division of the said territory into distinct and republican States, not more than five nor less than three in number, as the situation of that country and future circumstances might require. And the said United States, in Congress assembled, hath, in an ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio, passed on the thirteenth of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven,” declared the following as one of the articles of compact between the original States and the people and States in the said territory, viz: “That there shall be formed in the said territory not less than three, nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the said States, as soon as Virginia shall alter her act of cession and consent to the same, shall become fixed and established as follows, to wit: The western State in the said territory shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and Wabash Rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and Post Vincent's, due north to the territorial line between the United States and Canada, and by the said territorial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The middle States shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash from Post Vincent’s to the Ohio; by the Ohio, by a direct line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami to the said territorial line, and by the said territorial line. The eastern State shall be bounded by the lastmentioned direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania and the said territorial line: Provided, however, and it is further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three States shall be subject so far to be altered, that, if Congress shall hereafter find it expedient, they shall have authority to form one or two States in that part of the said territory which lies north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan. And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted by its delegates into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatsoever; and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided, the constitution and government so to be formed shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the Confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.” And it is expedient that this Commonwealth do assent to the proposed alteration, so as to ratify and confirm the said article of compact between the original States and the people and States in the said territory: Be it therefore enacted by the general assembly, That the afore-recited article of compact between the original States and the people and States in the territory northwest of Ohio River be, and the same is hereby, ratified and confirmed, anything to the contrary in the deed of cession of the said territory by this Commonwealth to the United States notwithstanding.

In the particular situation which you are placed, the capricious conduct of the Indians must give you great anxiety. I am persuaded everything will be done on your part that can be with propriety to avoid a War, and if that event should be inevitable that the evils of it may be justly charged to the Indians. We shall be impatient to learn the result of your present negotiations, which in any case will be highly interesting.

THE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR, NEW YORK 28 Jamy 1789 DEAR SIR I was a few Days ago honored with your's of the 13 of last month "–It contains much useful Information, and there is Reason to regret that the foederal government is so circumstanced as not to be in capacity to take the measures which their affairs require. A Sufficient number of Delegates to form a Congress not being convened, I thought it my Duty to consult those who are here, on the answer proper to be given to that Part of your Letter which respects Conolly. They are of opinion with me, That a watchful Eye should be kept over him; and if found chargeable with the Practices you mention (either within your Jurisdiction, or that of one of the States) that he should be apprehended, and delivered to the State in which the offences may be committed, together with the Evidence of them— but if the offences should be committed within your Jurisdiction it will be best to detain him until Congress shall give orders on the Subject. There not being any foederal Tribunal, nor general Laws for defining and punishing Treason against the united States—nor a congress sitting, nor likely soon to be convened, are Reasons for leaving such offenders to the Judicatures of the States in which their offences may be committed, until the new Governm' shall be in operation. We think it best that your Suspicions and Intentions respecting Conolly, should be kept as secret as possible—the less he is put on his Guard the better; and if he should be apprehended, it would be expedient to endeavour to take his Papers also. As his apprehension would probably occasion national Inquiries and Discussions, previous Attention should be paid to the obtaining and establishing satisfactory Proof of the facts with which he may be charged— I promised myself the Pleasure of writing to you again by the next Post, and with Sentiments of great Esteem & Regard I am Dear Sir Your most ob" & hble Serv" JOHN JAY- HIS EXCELLENCY ARTHUR Sº CLAIR Esq."

THE SECRETARY OF CONGRESS TO SECRETARY SARGENT [MHS: Sargent Papers: ALS*] NEW YORK March 11. 1789 SIR, I have received your favour of the 15 Jan’ ” together with your official communications containing copies of the laws acts & public records from the 9 July 1788 to 31 December inclusive.” I presume you consider the transactions with the Indians as not being a part of “the public records of the district” or “of the proceedings of the Governor in his executive department” and therefore have omitted sending them.

Was the Governour in the Territory I would obtain a Copy of my Oath, but his Absence puts it out of my Power— & should My Letter enclosing it have miscarried, unless some certificate of his in New York (where I suppose him by this Time to be) shall induce the Board of Treasury to make me Payment, I must be reduced to very disagreeable Necessities—for my private Funds are inadequate to the Exigencies of Subsistence alone, & I am involved in all the Expenses of Office without the Prospect of any immediate Reimbursements.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, NEW YORK May 2" 1788 [9] SIR I have the honor to lay before you the Treaties concluded, in pursuance of the Instructions received from Congress on the twenty sixth of October 1787 " and second of July 1788,” with several of the Indian Nations in January last.”—That they were not prescribed at an earlier period was owing, in part, to my own Indisposition—to the severity of the Winter which rendered the Communication by the Ohio, for a long time impracticable—and to the Circumstance that the last Congress did not assemble after it was in my power to have sent them forward. With the Treaties I beg leave to submit the Minutes of the proceedings at the different Meetings after the Nations were assembled, and I have added to them, by way of appendix, all the Letters and Messages that passed between them and me prior to their assembling.—These were communicated to the Secretary at War from time to time, and tho' they will, not doubt, be submitted by him to your Consideration, I thought it best, as they form a considerable part of the transactions, to connect them in that way, that the whole might be seen together. By the Instruction of July the second, I was directed to endeavour at extending the northern Boundary, as far north as the Completion of the forty first Degree of North Lattitude.—Besides that it would have been extremely difficult to have made the Indians comprehend how that was to be assCertained, I found that any Attempt to extend the limits at that time would be very ill received, if not defeat entirely the settling a Peace with them; it was therefore not proposed, and the Boundaries remain as settled at the former Treaties except the rectifying an Error about the Portage at the Miami Village.” The Negociation was both tedious and troublesome, and for a long time had an unpromising Aspect, but it came at last to as favorable an Issue as could have been expected—and I trust will be attended with Consequences freindly to the frontier parts of the united States.— There are however several Nations on the Wabash, and the Rivers which empty themselves into it, that are ill disposed; and from whom there is reason to expect that a part of the Frontier of Virginia and the Settlement forming on the Miami, will meet annoyance."—indeed that they have not been disturbed during the Winter was not expected, either by me or the Chiefs of the Nations who met me at Fort Harmar. The Wyandots did appoint Persons to go to them and inform them of the Result of the Treaty, and insist upon their desisting from farther Hostilities, which may have had some Effect in producing the late Tranquillity. The claim of the Wyandot Nation to the Lands reserved to the Shawanese was strongly insisted upon by them, and to be made an Article of the Treaty:—to that I could not consent: but to satisfy them, and that it might be kept in Remembrance, it is inserted at the Bottom of it, by way of Memorandum. It seems this is a Claim that has always been held up, and the Reason it was so much insisted on at this time, they said was, that they were sure that the Shawanese, and Cherokees incorporated with them would continue to give us trouble:—that it could not be expected to be borne with, much longer:-that they would be driven out of the Country, and then it would be claimed and held by the united States by right of Conquest— they farther added that, if the Shawanese continued their depradations, they would, themselves, drive them off.-They also proposed that a Post should be taken, by the united States, at the Miami Village as the surest Means to overaw the Nations on the Wabash.- It is certainly well situated for that purpose, and would command the greatest part of the Indian Trade.—As it was very uncertain whether Congress might approve of such a Measure; as a Post so far in Land would with difficulty be supported, and were in no readiness to carry it into Execution if it should be approved, I desired them to consider well whether it could be done without a Contest with the Indians who live there—and whether, in that Case, there was not Danger of they themselves being involved thro’ the ungovernableness of their Young Men.—They acknowledged they thought there was danger of both, but promised to send some of their principal Men to the Miamies and prepare them for receiving a Garrison peaceably, and are to give me Notice in the Spring. The Reason why the Treaties were made separately with the six Nations and the Wyandots & more westerly Tribes was a Jealousy that subsisted between them, which I was not willing to lessen by appearing to consider them as one People—they do not so consider themselves; and I am persuaded their general Confederacy is entirely broken: indeed it would not be very difficult, if Circumstances required it to set them at deadly variance." The great length of time that elapsed between the appointed period for the Meeting, and that at which the Indians assembled, during which, Numbers of them were constantly going and coming, has encreased the Expence in the Article of Provisions considerably; the utmost possible OEconomy however was used thro the whole of the Business, and in transacting it, I flatter myself with meeting the Approbation of Congress With the utmost Respect I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient and most humble Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  Entd Book of Reports & Communications Fol: 1. . 1" Sess. Ex. 1" Con: From the Governor of the Western Territory to the President of the United States May 2" 1789.
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO CONGRESS, NEW YORK, May 16*, 1789. GENTLEMEN, In estimating the sums of money that will be wanted this present year on the Northern Indian Department, it will be necessary to take into view the services that were ordered to be performed in the last year, and the appropriations for these services, as well as the ordinary expenses. One service ordered was a Treaty with the Six Nations and the Western Indians for the purposes of establishing a boundary with them and removing every cause of complaint for which there was appropriated the sum of fourteen thousand dollars.” By a subsequent Resolution of Congress,” the farther sum of twenty thousand dollars was appropriated—the whole of which, and six thousand out of the first fourteen thousand was to be applied solely and exclusively to the expenses of the Treaty, and the consideration to be paid for obtaining conveyances of the lands that had been ceded, making dollars. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $26,000 The consideration paid to, and the expenses of the treaty held with these Indians amounted to (say) . . . . . 18,000 There remains, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 8,000 But the provisions issued to the Indians and others from the time the Negociation began until the Treaty was signed, amounted to something more than that ballance, so that there will remain of the whole appropriated sum, if the provisions be set against it, something less than eight thousand dollars. Another service ordered the last year was the extinguishing the Indian Titles to the lands on the Mississippi,” for which there was no appropriation. Probably Congress expected that the thirty-four thousand dollars would be sufficient for both, and it would have been nearly so, exclusive of the provisions. But the provisions may be paid for either out of that money, or settled in the general account of the contractor who supplied them. In either way it makes not any difference to the United States. But if the value of them is deducted from the money appropriated, it will be necessary to bring into the estimate a farther sum for completing the above service. The whole expense of that business, provisions included, (for there will be a longer transportation, and the provisions are dearer at the Mississippi than where the other Treaty was held) can fall very little short of twenty thousand dollars, . . . . . . . . . . 20,000. Measures are yet to be taken with the Shawanese, the Miamies, and other Nations on the Wabash, which may probably cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10,000 The ordinary expenses of the department amount to about . . 4, 700 34, 700 Deduct the balance of the money appropriated, (say) . . . 8,000 26,000 Something more then than twenty-six thousand seven hundred dollars will be wanted for the objects in contemplation at present, within that Department, if the value of the provisions is deducted from the monies that have been appropriated. If it is not deducted from those monies, there will be required but eighteen thousand seven hundred. The Board, however, must best know whether it will not be proper to include in the estimate the whole thirty-four thousand dollars, besides the ten thousand that it is supposed will be wanted for the business with the Wabash people; for, though they have been directed to apply that that sum to Indian Affairs, it has not been, I believe, included in any requisition. The sum then necessary to cover the whole will be forty-eight thousand seven hundred dollars. Besides all this, the Indians frequently receive small quantities of provisions at the different posts where they come in to visit from time to time. This is a custom derived to us from the British, and cannot be got rid of at once. It may amount to two thousand rations per annum—these have always been settled on the Commissaries Account, and do not appear as a charge against the Department—they are probably included in the estimates of the Secretary at War—the Indian Department being under his control. The ordinary expenses of the Department are as follows: The Salary of the Governour of the Western Territory as Superintendant, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 800 Ditto for two Deputies at 500 each, . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000 Ditto for two Interpreters, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 400 Pay to occasional Messengers, their horses and other expenSeS, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 400 Clothing from prisoners returning from captivity, say 20 pr annum at $20. . . . . . . . . - - - - - - - - - - 400 A Storekeeper, . . . . . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 200 Incidental charges, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 Presents to Indians, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 000 $4,700 I have the honour to be, with great respect, Gentlemen, Your very humble servant, ARTHUR ST.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  NEW YORK June 14. 1789– TO THE HONORABLE MAJOR GENERAL KNOX- SIR I have been honored with your letter of the 12" " and in reply have to observe that by the resolution of Congress of the 29" of August 1788 " I was directed to repair to the Mississippi, in order to hold a treaty with the Indians who inhabit the country upon that river, for the extinguishing their claims to Lands within certain limits, if any such claims existed and to lay out certain donations of Land to the ancient inhabitants, from thence I was to proceed to Post Sº Vincennes upon the Wabash and lay out like donations for the inhabitants there, but the instructions contained no directions to make any purchase about the Post, from a presumption I suppose that a Cession had been made there to the Crown of France—With the remainder of the Goods from former treaties and the warrants I have received from the board of treasury, there is sufficient I suppose in my hands to defray the expence of the treaty with the Missisippi Indians, exclusive of the provisions—What they may amount to I can not ascertain, as I am ignorant of the indian numbers—they are inconsiderable; but an immediate provision for the payment of the provisions either for that or any Treaty is not necessary, the contractors being obliged to furnish all rations that may be required by the United States. Should it be thought proper to treat with the Indians of the Wabash and Miami a further sum will be necessary, and I have enclosed an estimate of what the expence would probably amount to—It appears indeed of absolute necessity that these Savages should be brought to peace either by treaty or by force. It is impossible for me to judge what sum would induce them to extend the northern boundary of the last cession to the Missisippi— Neither is it very well known what nations are the proprietors of the country that would be obtained by that extension—perhaps a provisional power to make such agreements and limiting the sum might not be improper, as the expence of another meeting for that purpose might be avoided if the proprietors attended at the treaty in contemplation—The stipulations could be made then and the payments at an after period. - I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient Servant sign'd) A* Sº CLAIR is Printed also in Smith (ed.), St. Clair Papers, II, 115–117.

Sans approuver les voies defait parles quelles vous vous etes emparé des biens de la mission des Cahos Je vous dirai qu'il est vrai qu’en 1768 le dit seminaire a qui appartenoit la mission des Cahokias se determina faute de sujets d'en abbandonner le soin a Msr Jean Ol.

Souvenez vous seutement que cet abbandonná été fait qu'a condition 1° que le seminaire n'entreroit en façons quelquonques dans les frais de recouvrement ni dans aucuns debours de quelque nature quil soit 2 que le dit seminaire ne seroit dans la suite aucunement chargé de pourvoir a votre desserte. Le seminaire na pas changé de dessein mais messieurs pour conduire cette affaire a sa perfection, et la rendre solide il faudroit un acte devant notaire qui donna a la fabrique de votre paroisse la dite proprieté, aux fins ci dessus enoncèes avec cet acte on vous doelivrœroit les titres et papiers concernaints la dite proprieté et pour ce faire nous ne voyons guere d'autre moyen que de deputer ad hoc quelque personne intelligente d'entre vous qui en faisant peutetre d'autres affaires en Canada feroit celle lá nous ne delivrerons point ces precieux titres sans quelque arrangement juridique. Au reste nous croyons que les negres appartenants autrefois a la mission ont prescrit leur liberté et nous n'entrons aucunement dans vos vues pour les forcer a lesclavage la providence la leur adonné cette precieuse liberte a dieu ne plaise que nous consentions a ce qu'on la leur ote. Vous supposes dans votre lettre que le chapitre ou l'eveque de Quebec avoient quelque proprieté dans le bien temporel de cette mission vous vous trompez c'est un seminaire des missions etrangeres de Quebec seul qu'ils appartenoient. Vous supposez encore que votre paroisse de la Sº famille est encore quant au spirituel sous la jurisdiction de l'eveque de Quebec mais Je vous dirai sur cela que le S" Siege la soumise au prefet apostolique des etats unis et que l'eveque de Quebec n'a point reclamé vu'que vos cantons ne sont plus sous la dominacion britannique. Voila oû en sont maintenant les choses changeront, elles? Je ne le crois pas mais Je n'en reponds pas absolument. C'est pour cela que je ne reponds pas a M" S" Pierre parceque c'est au prefet apostolique qu'il doit s'addresser pour la jurisdiction. Encore une fois il seroit bien utile que quelqu'un de vous vint a Quebec pour s'instruire et terminer avec nous une affaire que vous devez regarder comme tres importante pour votre paroisse et qui peut la rendre florissante.

To Messrs. Ducharme Dubu saucies, Girardin Chatel, Du Mai, La Croix Biron inhabitants and Church Wardens of the Holy Family of Cahos in the Illinois Country. MESSIEURS: Two years ago the Superior and directors of the Seminary of Quebec founders and former owners of the Mission of the Cahokias in the Illinois Country received a letter dated June 6, 1787, signed as in the above address, a copy of which you have undoubtedly retained. The difficulty of sending you a reply thereto has prevented us from doing so until now, as many of the letters which we had previously written to your cantons had been intercepted or at least appear not to have been received. Without approving the violent acts by which you have taken possession of the property of the mission of Cahos, I shall tell you that it is true that in 1768 the said seminary to which the mission of the Cahokias belonged decided, on account of the lack of pupils to entrust the care thereof to Monseigneur Jean Ol. Briand, at that time titular bishop, and that the seminary gave a power of attorney to Mr. Gibault, a missionary sent by the said bishop to bring about juridically, and in agreement with the inhabitants of the said mission of Cahokias the annulment of every sale and alienation accomplished by Mr. Forget, the last missionary sent by the seminary of Quebec, of the movable and immovable property of the said mission in order that the said property might hereafter be allotted to the expenses and maintenance of the missionaries, in view of the fact that the said Forget was by no means authorized to effect such alienation. The power of attorney is no longer valid at the seminary, but you have conserved it there. Bear clearly in mind that this abandonment was effected only on condition that: (1) the seminary would in no way be involved in the expenses of recovery or in any expenses whatsoever; (2) that the said seminary would not subsequently be in any way required to provide for your service. The seminary has not changed its purpose, but, Gentlemen, in order to bring this business to a satisfactory conclusion and to settle it definitely, there would be required a notarial act which would convey the said property to the vestry-board of your parish, for the purposes above indicated. With this act the titles and papers concerning the said property would be delivered to you, and in order to do so, we hardly see any other means than to delegate ad hoc some intelligent person among you who, perhaps while transacting other business in Canada, would take care of this matter. We shall not deliver these valuable titles without some legal arrangement. Moreover, we believe that the negroes formerly belonging to the mission have gained their liberty by prescription and we by no means join in your intention of forcing them into slavery. Providence has bestowed on them this precious gift of liberty and God forbid that we should consent to their being deprived of it. You assume in your letter that the chapter or the Bishop of Quebec held some equity in the temporal property of this mission. You are mistaken. It belongs only to the seminary of the foreign missions of Quebec. You also assume that your parish of the Holy Family is still, with regard to spiritual matters under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Quebec, but I beg to advise you on this point that the Holy See has placed it under the Apostolic Prefect of the United States and that the Bishop of Quebec has made no protest, in view of the fact that your cantons are no longer under British dominion. That is the present state of things. Will they change? I do not believe so, but I cannot be absolutely sure of it. That is why I do not reply to Mr. St. Pierre, because it is to the Apostolic Prefect that one must apply as to jurisdiction. Once again, it would be very expedient for some one of you to come to Quebec to inform himself and settle with us a matter which you must consider as very important for your parish and which may make it prosperous. With the assurance of my high consideration I am, Gentlemen, Your very humble and obedient servant, GRAvić Superior of the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Quebec.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT. To the President of the United States [August, 1789) A Memorial respecting the Territory of the united States north west of the River Ohio.— - The Country, generally known by the appellation of the western Territory, is a Tract of Land bounded by the western Limits of Pennsylvania on the East; by the River Ohio on the South; by the River Missisippi on the West; and by the Line of separation between the United States and the Province of Quebec on the North. This extensive Region is blessed with a fertile Soil and desirable Climate in every part of it which has yet been explored; and the Inhabitants of the neighbouring States, very early discovered a strong Disposition to take Possession of it:—Congress, in order to turn that Disposition to the public Advantage, and to secure to the united States the Benefits that were expected to flow from the right to the Soil, as a fund for discharging the Domestic Debts, gave orders that it should be sold,” and established a form of Government for the future Inhabitants: Sales have been made of some considerable Portions of it—A Number of People, from various parts of the United States have been introduced, and the Government has been organized. It is the Duty of the Secretary to transmit to Congress, every six Months, the Detail of the Governors proceedings, as well as Copies of the Laws that have been adopted and published by him and the Judges, who are constituted temporary Legislators until the Inhabitants reach to a certain Number.—This has been done, and they will, of course, be laid before the President thro' the proper Officer.—But there are some things, that should be made known, that cannot be properly communicated in that Way, which I beg your Permission to submit to your Notice. In the Ordinance for establishing the Government there is no Provision for its Administration in case of the Death Resignation or necessary Absence of the Governor—This is a Defect that requires to be supplied, more especially as the Management of Indian Affairs is a part of the Governors Duty, and will sometimes render his Absence unavoidable.”— The Governor and Judges or a Majority of them are to adopt and publish such Laws of the original States, Criminal and Civil, as they judge proper and best suited to the Circumstances of the Territory; and they are to be in force until disaproved by Congress. There are upon the Missisippi and Wabash Rivers a considerable Number of People, the remains of the ancient french Colony, who have been accustomed to be governed by the Laws of France, the Customs of Canada, and the arbitrary Edicts of the british Commandants, after they fell under the Power of Britain:-there are also some People there, who migrated from Virginia after the Cession of the Country to the united States. A Settlement is begun between the great and little Miami composed of Emigrants from Virginia and New Jersey, but principally from the last. The Reservation, for the Virginia Officers, upon the Scioto River, has turned the Attention of many to that part of the Country, and a Settlement will be made there, so soon as it shall be laid open, by People from Virginia and the District of Kentucky where they have been used to the Laws & Customs of Virginia.-Higher up the Ohio comes the Country purchased by the Ohio Company, which being composed of Adventurers, chiefly, from Massachusets, Connecticut and Rhode Island, the first Inhabitants are, and will be, from those States—Above that a gain are the Ranges of Townships part of which have been sold, and as they are now the Property of Persons in New York, Jersey and Pennsylvania the Settlements will be made by People from those States—to the north of the last is the Connecticut Reservation, which that State is now disposing of-and to the north of the Ohio Companys Tract one of the Reservations for the late Army lays.”—Laws that are to run thro’ so great an extent of Country, and are to operate upon People who have very different Habits and Customs require to be very attentively considered; and it would seem that they should be composed rather by an intermixture of those of all the original States, than that the Acts of any one particular State should be adopted—there would otherwise be a danger of introducing Regulations, proper enough for a small territory, which would not suit an extensive Country, circumstanced as the western Territory will be with respect to the Habits of its People. The Laws and Customs of the four New England States have a great Affinity to each other.— Persons who have lived long under any System of Law contract a Veneration for it.—The Judges, who it is to be supposed will always be professional Men, used to contemplate the Laws of the States where they have lived with a favorable Eye, and from one point of View only, will see Excellencies in each that are not so obvious to others:—each of them will have a predilection for those he has been used to:—By discussing the Principles upon which they have been respectively founded, and comparing their Operation and Effects, an intermixture that would suit the whole Country, and tend to make the Inhabitants one People, would probably be obtained, without shocking too much the prejudices of any—to that End it seems necessary that the Judges should be drawn from different parts of the united States. Two of the three Judges were from New England, and one from New Jersey*— All of them deeply interested, as Proprietors, in the Tracts of Country that had been sold. It may be a Question whether some Inconveniencies may not arise from the last Circumstance, (for Interest often hangs, insensibly to the Persons themselves, a Biass upon the Minds of very honest and upright Men) and that the Advantage of a District might be preferred to the Interest of the Territory. That part of the Ordinance which constitutes the Governor and Judges the temporary Legislators of the Territory is not clearly expressed, and requires Explanation. A Difference of Sentiment arose between the Governor and Judges upon the true meaning and design of it. The Judges contended that, from the Words, where two only of them agreed to a Law, there the concurrence of the Governor was necessary; but where all three agreed, they had a Power to promulgate, tho' his Concurrence should be refused. This was thought a dangerous Doctrine, and agreeable to neither the Spirit nor the Words of the Ordinance. The Governor thought it a discription of official, not numerical, Persons, of whom the he must always be one—that the true Interpretation was, that the Governor and the Judges, or the Governor with any two of the Judges shall have power to adopt and publish Laws, but the Judges without the Governor shall not have that power. It seems proper that the Governor should have power to stop a law which might be injurious to the united States, more especially when it is recollected that, as proprietors in large Districts, the Judges may have a separate Interest.—It is believed that an Attempt would have been made to establish the Construction of the Judges had not Death removed one of them *—In that Case, the Governor would have thought himself bound in Duty to have forbid Obedience by Proclamation, until the Sense of Congress on the Subject could be known, and the utmost Confusion must have ensued.” It seems to have been the Intention of Congress that entire Laws of some of the original States, or so much of them as would apply to their Circumstances, should be adopted for the Government of the People. But it was found that the Judges were not possessed of the Codes of the different States—that few of the Laws in the Collections they were in possession of would apply, those made in the earlier Stages, and most likely to suit the present State of the Territory, having been generally repealed as the State of Society had changed.— it therefore became necessary that Laws, corresponding as nearly as possible to those of the original States, should be formed—their first formation was thought to be within the Province of the Judges in their legislative Capacity, the Governor reserving to himself the right to suggest such Alterations & Amendments as he should think necessary, either for the good of the People or the Interest of the united States, and finally to approve or reject them. The Laws that have been published were framed in that manner,” and the Governors Observations upon them, in the first Stage, have been recorded with the Secretary of the Territory to be laid before Congress with his other Proceedings.” The present Governor pretends not to a knowledge of Law—He may be succeeded by another under the same Disadvantage:—He would therefore suggest the Propriety of appointing an Attorney General,” with such a Salary as might be some inducement to a Man of professional Abilities, and it should be declared to be a part of his Duty, to give his Opinion to the Governor upon all Laws proposed to be adopted, and to be responsible for his Opinions. The Governor by the Ordinance has power to appoint an Attorney General but not to give him a Salary—and if the Appointment was made by him the Attorney would be an Officer of the Territory only, whereas he should be an Officer of the United States.—It should also be made his Duty to sue for, or defend, the property of the united States in civil Cases, and this is the more necessary because, a considerable part of the Country on the Mississippi is, or will be, claimed and taken Possession of, under Grants obtained in an irregular, if not a fradulent Manner. He would also suggest the necessity of a Printer. People cannot be expected to pay Obedience to Laws they never heard of, or could hear of. and it is impossible to spread them sufficiently thro’ that Country by Writing—besides that there is no fund for which the Copiers can be paid, and if there was a fund, it is believed the Expence would be equal to if not greater, than what would be incurred by establishing a printing Press. It would be convenient that an express Power should be delegated to the Governor to fix the Seat of Government where the principal Offices, & particularly that of the Prothonotary of the supreme Court, should be kept:—without that provision the Judges may think it belongs to them to determine where the Offices of their Court shall be; and as two of them are now deeply interested in particular Districts, it is not probable that a Law which should carry them, out of one or other of them, to another part of the Country could be obtained. The western Territory, taking a comprehensive View of it, is an interesting and very important Appendage to the united States— The fertility of the Soil and temperature of Climate seem to point it out as the Place to which the Emigrations from the Atlantic States should naturally be directed.—The foundation of a great additional Strength may be laid in that Country. Circumstanced as it is in many respects its Growth will probably be astonishingly rapid. It is unnecessary to enquire whether those Emigrations will not be hurtful to the Atlantic States:—the removal of so many of their People suddenly, and much Property with them, must be very sensibly felt for a long time.—a regular Account is taken at Fort Harmar of all that pass down the Ohio–it is said an equal number go thro' what is called the Wilderness*—The spirit however has gone forth, and cannot now be restrained; but it may well be doubted whether the Peopling that Country will ultimately be of Advantage to the Union; or at least, before any Advantage can accrue from it, whether it may not, by means of that Population, be involved in Difficulties. The Influence of the general Government will not be much felt amongst that People, from the great Distance they are removed from the Seat of it; neither will their connection with, or dependance upon it, be very apparent.— Many of their Productions, perhaps all of them, must be the same with those of the old States—Should the Navigation of the Mississippi be open to them they would soon become Rivals, and look upon each other with all the Malevolence that usually attends such a Situation.— Should it continue interdicted, they will become Idle, restless and disatisfied.—With the English Colonies on one side and the Spanish on another, they will be exposed to the Machinations of both those Governments, and in Case of a War with one or both of them (an Event that may not be very far distant) they might be tempted to throw off all Connection with the Parent States, and put themselves under the protection of the one or the other of them. It is not to be doubted that the most alluring Hopes and Promises would be held out to them. It is certain that the British have already had Emissaries amongst the People of the Kentucky District," apparently to stimulate them to Hostilities against the Spaniards, but most probably to cherish the Disposition to revolt, which has appeared there, by intimations that they would be supported from Canada. In these Transactions the british Government will not be committed, and on either Event taking Place, their purpose might be gained.—In the Case of a Revolt, the leaders might look up both to Spain and Britian; and it seems not to be impracticable to spread it from the Frontiers of Georgia to Vermont inclusive.—In Case of Hostilities with Spain, an Alliance would probably be formed between those Nations—their joint Force would be exerted against America, while she would probably stand single; for it is not to be expected that France would support her in a Case where, prima facie, the Wrong would appear to be on her side; and to do which she must change the whole System of the political Combinations she has been preparing for many Years— The Issue would most probably be disastrous. Spain, also, looks with Jealousy and Discontent at the Growth of the western Country. Her Minister has marked its Progress with Attention, and has probably discovered that, tho it forms at present a part of the united States, the Ligature that binds them together is a weak one; and the Authority of the General Government over it is not well established. It is strongly suspected that he has an Understanding with some leading Characters, and that thro' them, the desire to throw off all Connection both with Virginia and the Union, is spread among the People. It seems likewise to be the Expectation of that Court, that the Country they possess upon the Missisippi may be peopled from the united States.—They hold out temptations that will succeed with many who have little other governing Principle beside the Desire of Wealth—a thousand Acres of Land, free of Purchase and Taxes—ten Dollars per hundred for Tobacco, and six Dollars for Pork or Beef delivered at New Orleans are offered to all who will remove into Florida, and produce those Articles. Should many People be induced to remove into that Country they will soon imbibe the spanish prejudices, and be more active to prevent any interference in this profitable Traffic than the Spaniards themselves. The Minister of that Court is also at work to divert the Emigrations from the United States to the west side of the Mississippi; and he has met with a very proper Agent, M* Morgan, who possesses a great Degree of Activity and Insinuation. Many People now hold themselves in readiness to follow him, infatuated to such a Degree that they are parting with very valuable Possessions on the most disadvantageous Terms. His Expectations, however, for laying the foundation of his Settlement, are turned to Kentucky, where there are many People who have been disapointed in obtaining Land, by the monopolizing Spirit that seized the first Adventures, and now hold it at Price beyond the reach of the Others; and Land being the first Object of their pursuit, they are ready to go to any Country where it can be easily obtained; But Promises of the free Exercise of their Religion;– to be governed by their own Laws; and to receive a very great Price for every thing they can raise and send to New Orleans, are superadded.—Many will make the Experiment and they and their Progeny be lost—They will become Spaniards to all intents and purposes—and should it still be designed to prevent the Navigation of the Missisippi, the Situation, directly opposite to the Mouth of the Ohio, seems not to have been ill chosen with that View. The Spanish Commandant at Sº Louis “ has also been assiduously endeavouring to induce the french Inhabitants to abandon their Country, and has succeeded with a great Many. Should it be thought an Object, with Congress, to prevent this loss of People and Property (for every Man carries with him more or less of it) it might perhaps be effected by laying open a part of the Western Territory for those who want Land and cannot pay for it immediatly—The Lands upon the Missisippi and Wabash are very inviting and as Settlements are already made upon each of these Rivers would probably be preferred.—They might be set at a moderate rate and an Office opened, where any person might locate them in small Quantities, and where, upon the payment of the purchase Money, which should run upon Interest, they should receive Patents. The People, the loss of whom is the greatest any Country can suffer, would be saved—the Country would be cultivated, and the Union would derive nearly the same Advantage as if the Lands had been paid for in the first Instance; for an Interest would accrue to it, equal to the Interest accruing against it, so far as the appropriations went. This is not a visionary Project, but warranted by Experience, the whole Country of Pennsylvania, while it remained in the Hands of the Propritaries, having been settled in that manner. Besides it seems certain that the Sale of the Country in large Districts, if it ever was an eligible manner of disposing of it, is now over; and some such Mode must be adopted if any further Advantage is expected from it. The Apprehension that the Choice Spots only would be taken, and the rest remain unregarded, is not well founded if carried to any great Degree.—The choicest Spots would doubtless be first taken, but the intermediate Lands, tho of less value, abstractedly considered, would soon be in equal Demand—A Fact which has been asscertained in every part of America where that mode of granting Lands has been practised.—It seems worth while to make the Experiment, especially as it can be done without Expence for the Fees would be a sufficient compensation to the Officers it would be necesary to employ in it. The Expectation that the Domestic Debt might be paid off, or very much lessned, by selling that Country in large Portions, was never very well founded.—The Experiment that has been made has evinced it. The real Money that has been laid out, and must still be laid out to compleat the Surveys would have bought in much more of the Debt than the Sale of the Land has brought into the Treasury. Tho', by the above method, a great Number of People, who will otherwise remove into a foreign Country, might be induced to fix within the Territory of the united States, the Danger from their insidious Neighbours would not be at all lessned. Two Things seem necessary to that End viz, that the People of Kentucky should be made easy, by being allowed to erect themselves into a separate State, and being received into the Union as a Member of it—and that the military Establishment in the western Country should be encreased. A handful of Troops, scattered in small Posts from Venango to the Mississippi, without connection or dependance upon each other, can neither awe the one nor restrain the other. It would seem to be necessary that a Force in some Degree respectable should be stationed in that Country, and that Posts much farther advanced than the present ones should be taken.—The British, if they have ill Designs would be kept in some Check, and those Designs be more readily discovered:—Their Influence over the Savages would be lessned, and a very advantageous Trade with them, which now goes to Canada, would be turned into the united States. The People would derive Security, at the same time that they saw and felt that the Government of the Union was not a mere shadow:—their progeny would grow up in habits of Obedience and Respect—they would learn to reverence the Government; and the Countless multitudes which will be produced in that vast Region would become the Nerves and Sinews of the Union. - The Connecticut Reservation is a Tract of Land lying along the western Boundary of Pennsylvania. The Deed of Cession,” of Claims to Western Lands, made by that State to the united States takes for a beginning a Line drawn paralel to the western Boundary of Pennsylvania, one hundred and twenty Miles West from it, so that the Space between those lines is impliedly confirmed to Connecticut; and it was understood in Congress when the Cession was accepted, that it would be considered by the State as confirmed, and would be disposed of in what manner that Government might think proper—the Jurisdiction remains with the united States. Judge Parsons has notified the Governor of the western Country that he had contracted with the State of Connecticut to run the outlines of the Tract; but, as the United States were a party in the Business, the line, to be run one hundred and twenty Miles west of Pennsylvania, being a territorial boundary between them and Connecticut, and as it did not appear that they had been consulted, or even had notice of the Intention to ascertain the Boundaries, the Governor did not think proper to permit him to proceed—It may be necessary that He should receive Instructions on that Head, and that the Geographer, or some other Person on the part of the united States should attend the Survey.

PROCLAMATIONS OF THE SPANISH GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA AND WEST FLORIDA  No 2047 [September 2, 1789) By his Excellency Stephen Miro Esq." Brigadier General in the armies of his Catholic Majesty, Governor and intendant of the Provinces of Louisiana and West Florida &ce. A PROCLAMATION. Whereas his Majesty has been graciously pleased to permit the subjects and citizens of other countries to emigrate to his provinces of Louisiana and West Florida, by the Mississippi river with their stock, slaves, farming utensils, and household furniture, as also to introduce their property in the actual produce of the country from whence they come, promising to each family a tract of land from 240 to 800 acres in proportion to their numbers, free from all expense, as also exemption from taxation, and the private exercise of their religion: Now in order to fulfil these the benevolent intentions of my royal master, and guard against fraud or imposition, I have thought proper to issue this my proclamation, making known to all persons, who may become the subjects of his Majesty, that they will be duly protected in the rights and privileges before mentioned; but all and every person so emigrating, after taking the test of allegiance will be obliged, to render on oath a true account or invoice of the property they may bring down to the Governor of the district of Natches or the Commandant at l'anse à la graise, as the case may be, and solemnly to swear that no person or persons are directly or indirectly interested or concerned in the same, it being the intention of his Majesty to extend his royal bounty to actual settlers only, and any attempt to contravene this design will be punished with the utmost rigor. Given under my hand and seal at arms in the city of New Orleans, the second day of september one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine. Signed ESTEVAN MIRO Counter signed by his Excellency's command Andrew Lopes Armesto [September 6, 1789) His Majesty having been graciously pleased to encourage emigration to his Province of Louisiana, he has in his royal bounty determined to confer upon the emigrants the following rights, privileges and immunities. To all families consisting of two or three labouring persons, he will grant two hundred and forty acres (french measure) of land gratis: to such as consist of four labouring persons, and upwards, as far as ten, four hundred acres shall be given, when from ten to fifteen, six hundred; and when from sixteen upwards eight hundred acres shall be given. No person shall be molested in religious matters, though no public worship shall be allowed but that of the Roman Catholic church From the moment of their arrival in this Province, all persons shall be treated, and enjoy the same commercial privileges and protection as the ancient inhabitants, and shall be governed by the same laws and customs; for which purpose his Majesty will establish a commanding officer to protect the settlement against all insults. This officer will decide the controversies which may arise among the inhabitants, and all differences in matters of interest not exceeding the value of one hundred dollars. From this sum upwards the said Commander will hear the allegations of the parties, direct the proceedings, and transmit the same to New Orleans for the decision of this Government, unless the parties shall agree to submit their matters in controversy betwixt them to arbitration, in which case each party shall choose one or two arbitrators, and if they should not agree, the Commander shall name another to decide the matter. Every person emigrating into his Majesty's Province of Louisiana can bring his own property with him in the produce of the Country he comes from, such as peltries, tobacco, flax, hemp, cordage, flour, horses, sheep, Swine, cattle salt, and all sorts of provisions, free from duties with liberty to sell them to any post of the Province, or send the same for their own account to the outposts permitted for commerce to the inhabitants; but in this latter case they are to pay the duties established for exportation which is six per cent. At their arrival every head of a family answering for every individual of it shall take the oath of allegiance to his most Catholic Majesty, binding themselves to take up arms (only in defence of this Province) against any enemy whatsoever that shall attack it. It is his Majesty's intention to establish within proper distances Parish Churches, to be served by priests that may speak the english language but who shall have no right to interfere in religious matters, with those who may not be catholics, nor shall any tythes, or other pay be exacted from them. All subjects of his Majesty, shall have a free market at new Orleans for the produce of their lands or labour, and shall be exempt from all duties and taxes. It is his Majesty's orders, that his laws shall be administered with mildness and lenity, so as to render his subjects as happy as possible; for this purpose officers who are well qualified are appointed to govern the different settlements.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, NEW YORK Sep 14. 1789. SIR. The constant Hostilities between the Indians who live upon the river Wabash, and the people of Kentuckey must necessarily be attended with such embarrassing circumstances to the Government of the Western Territory, that I am induced to request you will be pleased to take the matter into consideration, and give me the orders you may think proper. It is not to be expected Sir, that the Kentuckey people will, or can, submit patiently to the cruelties and depredations of those savages.— they are in the habits of retaliation perhaps, without attending precisely to the nations from which the injuries are received.--they will continue to retaliate, or they will apply to the Governor of the western Country (through which the indians must pass to attack them) for redress;–If he cannot redress them, (and in present circumstances he cannot) they also will march through that country, to redress themselves, and the Government will be laid prostrate.—The united States, on the other hand are at peace with several of the nations; and, should the resentment of those people fall upon any of them, which it is likely enough may happen, very bad consequences will follow; for it must appear to them that the United States, either pay no regard to their Treaties, or that they are unable or unwilling to carry their engagements into effect.—Remonstrances will probably be made by them also to the Governor, and he will be found in a situation, from which he can neither redress the one, nor protect the other:-they will unite with the hostile nations, prudently preferring open war to a delusive and uncertain peace. By a resolution of the late Congress the Governor of the western Territory, had power, in case of hostilities, to call upon Virginia and Pennsylvania for a number of men to act in Conjunction with the continental troops, and carry war into the indian settlements.”—that resolution, it is now supposed, is no longer in force.—the revival of it might be of use, as it would tend to conciliate the western people, by shewing them that they were not unattended to; " and would in some measure Justify me in holding a language to the indians which might obviate the necessity of employing force against them.—The handful of Troops Sir, that are scattered in that country, tho' they may afford protection to some settlements, cannot possibly act offensively by themselves.

I believe & trust—But as we hear not of Judge Turner & since the Death of General Parsons there is only Judge Symmes left—the Territory must continue to suffer for the Want of Adoption and Publication of good & wholesome Laws—From various Causes there has been but Little Attention by the Gentlemen of the Bench to the important Business of their Commission.—I have given to the President General, the earliest Information of Judge Parson's Death, as it is most essential to us that he should be pleased to fill the Vacancy as soon as possible.

WINTHROP SARGENT THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  WAR OFFICE 19th December 1789 SIR, It is to be hoped and expected that you received your instructions from the President of the United States dated the 5" of October last” since which there has not been any thing written to, or received from you at this Office. As it is highly probable that you may before this letter can reach you be far down the Ohio it may not be prudent to be very particular in my communications. The people of Kentuckey are loud in their complaints of the murders that have been committed in that district during the last summer— The President of the United States has received several letters from the Principal characters in that quarter.” While he has directed that they be promised all the protection that he can reasonably afford, he has stated his opinion of the effects of the desultory expeditions into the Indian Country North west of the Ohio–an extract of a letter written by his direction to Samuel M"Dowell Esq." Chairman of the late Convention of Kentuckey District and dated the 15th instant is as follows “The President of the United States has desired that it may be clearly understood to be his opinion that the best foundation for peace with the Indians is by establishing just and liberal treaties with them—which shall be rigidly observed on our parts, and if broken on theirs to be effectually punished by legal authority. But irregular and unauthorized expeditions involve the innocent and guilty in equal calamity—make enemies of those disposed to be friends—disgrace government and defeat its designs.” And further that in future it is his just expectation that no expedition be undertaken agains the Indians North west of the Ohio, but with the approbation of the Governor of the said Territory, and the Commanding Officer of the federal troops who are particularly instructed on this subject.” The President of the United States is extremely desirous of a general treaty with the Wabash Indians as the only rational foundation of peace—If a treaty of peace was once effected, any partial breaches of it by the Indians could easily be punished—He therefore requests you to use your highest exertions for that purpose. The Letters from the Wabash and Mississippi state the necessity of your presence”—It is to be hoped that you will be able to proceed and accommodate the settlers with the lands to which they are entitled. The aspect of Affairs with the Creeks require a post to be established at the Muscle shoals on the Tennassee—provided the same can be effected with the entire approbation and support of the Chickasaws and Choctaws which there is reason to beleive may be obtained—and the President of the United States has directed that Major Doughty be sent to those tribes to ascertain their sentiments —If the post be established with an adequate force it will enable us either to intimidate the Creeks or to strike them with success. The train in which the Commissioners were constrained to leave that business bodes ill,” and at this time it is probable that M*Gillivray has decided with the Spaniards what line of conduct he shall pursue. I have suggested an idea to Brig. General Harmar, under the strongest injunctions of secrecy, excepting with yourself—Please to examine it, and if practicable assist him with your advice therein—Whether in your opinion it should be practicable or not pray retain it as a perfect Secret.” If you have any blankets or shrouds in store I pray you to deliver them to Major Doughty in order to present to the Chickasaws and Choctaws. º I have the honor to be With great respect Sir Your Most Obedient Humble Servant.

WILLIAM JACKSON TO JUDGE TURNER  NEW-YORK. December 23rd 1789. To GEORGE TURNER Esquire One of the Judges of the Western Territory DEAR SIR, The communication which I now make to you though painful, is friendly, and has no other object [but] your interest. I suggested to you, when in Philadelphia] that your delay, in repairing to the western—Terriſtory] would as certainly excite the President's displeasu[re] as I was convinced it would his disappointment. Accustomed to punctuality himself, he expects to [find] it in others— especially in the discharge of those truſsts] which involve the most interesting concerns of the [MS. torn]. You must excuse the freedom and force of thiſs] expression—it is the language of truth uttering sentiments of friendship—and better far it should be thus conveyed than take the form of an official communication. The President of the United States was told, yesterday, that you were still in Philad", and he is, indeed, much dissatisfied at the circumstance. Let me request you to do away his dissatisfaction by setting out immediately for the place of your official residence, where I wish you to reap a large harvest of honorable fame and private happiness. Being very sincerely Your friend W JACKSON.  To George Turner Esq. One of the Judges of the Western Territory December 23rd 1789 
DRAFT OF A PROPOSED MESSAGE TO THE SENATE 80  [December, 1789) Although I experience a reluctance in again bringing before you the subject of a treaty with the Wabash indians, yet as some recent events have happened evincing to my mind the propriety of the measure, I conceive it to be my duty to make the following communication, and to request your advice thereon. The indians residing on the Wabash river and its branches, and the people residing on the waters of the river Ohio, have been for some years past in the practice of exercising indiscriminate hostilities on each other—It would probably be in vain at this period to endevor to ascertain the original aggressors—The facts are but too well established that the innocent on both sides suffer more frequently than the guilty. The evils have extended themselves to the troops of the United States who are often sacrificed to the resentments of the Indians, which they have had no agency in exciting. Several Soldiers were killed during the last year by parties of Indians and several more during the present year, and by recent intelligence, a party of six, while escorting a Surveyor near the big Sandy river has been entirely cut off." - To patiently suffer a continuance of these enormities appears to be highly improper and disgraceful—and yet in the existing confused state of affairs, and ignorance of the perpetrators, it is difficult if not impossible, to know against what tribe to direct the vengeance of the United States—This circumstance which of itself is sufficient to create a doubt of the propriety of immediate coercive measures, is rendered more conclusive by a calculation of the expence and contingencies which would attend an effectual expedition into the Indian Country. If it is probable that a peace with the Wabash indians could be effected by a treaty, I am of opinion that it would be wise to attempt it—If the Indians should refuse to attend the invitation to a treaty the United States would be exonerated, from all imputations of injustice in taking proper measures for compelling the Indians to a peace, or to extirpate them. The Secretary at War has informed] me that it is probable the treaty with the Creeks will not require more than seventeen thousand dollars of the twenty thousand appropriated by Congress on the 20" of August 1789.” to the Indian Department—and that the Governor of the Western territory has in his possession Goods remaining from former treaties to the amount of one thousand eight hundred dollars. Although I conceive these sums to be very inadequate for treating in the customary manner with the Wabash tribes, yet perhaps it may be proper to make an experiment of treating with the indians on a more Oeconomical plan. On this statement of the case I request your advice on the following inquiries. First—In the existing state of affairs between the United States, and the Wabash Indians, will it be proper to attempt an establishment of peace with the said Indians by a friendly treaty? Second–If so shall the sum of three thousand dollars (provided that sum shall remain of the twenty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress on the 20" of August 1789, After defraying the expences of the treaty with the Creek indians) be applied to a treaty with the Wabash tribes of Indians, together with such goods as the Governor of the western territory has in his possession remaining from former treaties?  Notes submitted to the President (–useless)—

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [Addressed] The President of the United States New York. GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO MAJOR HAMTRAMCK  BOSTON March 19th 1790 Mr JEFFERSON SIR By the Treaty of Fort M*Intosh” the Lands contained within the following Boundary were allotted to the Wyandots & Delawares, and the Ottowas who were in actual Occupation; viz beginning at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River and running up the same to the portage between that and the Tuscarawas Branch of Muskingham; then down that Branch to the Forks at the crossing Place above Fort Lawrence; thence westerly to the portage on that Branch of the big Miami which runs into the Ohio, at the mouth of which branch the Fort stood which was taken by the french in 1752; thence along the said Portage to the great Miami or Omie River, and down the south east side of the same to its mouth; thence along the south shore of lake Erie to the mouth of Cuyahoga.-it seems to have been asumed as a principle that the whole of this Country was the property of the united States, and, by that Treaty, they gave to the Indians the Lands therein contained & the Lands lying east west and south were relinquished to the united States.—there are also certain reservations within those boundaries,” which are declared to be to the Use & under the Government of the united States—but by the 7"Article the general principle seems to have been departed from and the Country west and north west of the Miami of the Lakes considered as the property of the Indians. By the Treaty at Muskingham" the same Boundaries were confirmed with a small variation, which, as I have not the Treaty by me, I cannot point out, ” and certain lands laying without the Boundaries were sold and confirmed to the united States; at the same time an express declaration was made by the Wyandots that the Country to the westward of the Miami, from its Source to the Lake, excepting the Reservations, was the property of that Nation. By the Treaty of the Miami 9° a Tract of Country was op [MS. illegible] to the Shawanese by certain boundaries, and joining to that of the Wyandots and Delawares on one side.—A west line to the river de la Panse, and with that River to the Ouabash is the boundary on another side, and the Lands lying east west and south of the east west and south Lines are relinquished to the united States—the lands then from the mouth of the River de la Panse to the Ouabash, and from thence to the Ohio, and between that River and the Shawanese & Wyandot Boundaries, have been considered as the property of the united States so far at least as those Nations were interested in them—but between the Ouabash and the Ohio are the Ouiatanons, the Piankishaws, and the Miamies; with whom no Treaties have been held, and whose claims are not known with any degree of precision.—Sales have been made to individuals, before the Revolution of very considerable Tracts of Country, but without the approbation of the british Government. The whole of the Country between the Ouabash, the Illinois the Missisippi and the Ohio seems to have been considered by the French Government as the Domaine of the King—no Vestige of purchase or Cession from the Natives is to be found in the records of the Country.-The Officers of that Government either as the Agents of the Royal Company of the Indies, or immediatly of the King, granted the Lands at their pleasure, and the Officers of great Britain followed the example.” I wish Sir I could have given you more explicit information, but explicit information I suspect cannot be obtained. I have the honor to be Sir  Copy to the Secretary of Stateavez occasion d'envoyer quel qu'atre voiture, je vous serois obligé d'y faire passer trois esclaver appartenant a la succession du Colonel Hineson qui sont chez moi.

I thank you for your courtesy in giving me notice as to the boat which you are sending to the Anse à la Graisse. I cannot take advantage of it, in view of its precipitate departure, but if you have occasion to send some other conveyance, I should be obliged if you would have taken on three slaves belonging to the succession of Colonel Hineson, who are at my home.

I beg you to accept the thanks that I have the honor to offer you for all the attentions and courtesies that you have shown to Major Doughty and his unfortunate troop who have taken refuge with you. However, that is only what one would expect from the humanity and courtesy of your nation. One could not be more deeply touched than I am, and if the occasion arises I shall not fail to give you the most unequivocal proofs of the fact. I have taken the liberty to send ten soldiers with a non-commissioned officer without any passport to assist the Major with the rest of his little band to ascend the river and proceed to this point, and I feel sure thatin view of the circumstances you will not consider it improper that I have not lost time in attending to this formality. I have the honor to subscribe myself most respectfully, your very humble and very obedient servant. KASKASKIAS le premier d'avril 1790.

[Translation] KASKASKIAS, April 1, 1790. MY DEAR SIR: A man named Louviere, habitant of Prairie de Rochers, has represented to me that he has a slave belonging to him whom he had formerly lent to a certain man who is now dead, after which he ran away and has been given asylum by the heir of the said deceased person and is at present in the possession of Mr. Pratt acting as his agent, who wished to take him to New Orleans to return him to his alleged master. I am quite certain that Mr. Pratt does not desire to take any step in the case that he does not consider just, but as Louviere agrees to drop the matter, notwithstanding the decree of the court of this locality, until my arrival, and Mr. Pratt, seeing that there has been no claim on his part since, he may well think that he is justified in acting in accordance with his power of attorney. It seems to me that it is of importance for the inhabitants of each side that their fugitive slaves do not find an asylum with the others, and ifit happens that some from your side wish to take refuge with us, I shall promise to send them back, and, as I have no doubt that you are willing to do the same, I request you to arrest the negro in question until you are satisfied whether the claims of Louvier are justified or not.

This fact had not yet come to my knowledge, but, in accordance with your instructions on this subject, I shall write immediately to the village where he resides, which is seven leagues from here, and shall have the said child transported at once to that place by the above-mentioned Troje, in order that she may be returned to her parents, her removal from whom I would not have permitted, if they had presented to my Government a claim for something which is a matter of humanity and justice. I hope that some time tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, your wishes will be satisfied, and mine, the only object of which is that justice shall be completely fulfilled, if they can prove to you thereby what a friend I am of harmony and good understanding.

Au present monsieur J'ai de reconnoitre le livrance du dit enfant, et de vous informer que J'ai procedé sur les representations de la mere qui est marié chez un nommé piggot. Je crois bien qu'il y a etre une jugement de la cour de cette district en faveur de Troje; mais il ne se trouve pas au greffe; pourtant, Trojé ne niet pas que Piggot luiait offert payment en coshons ou betes â corne si il voudroit aller les prendre chez lui nonobstant que les arbetres sur l'opinion des quels, le jugement a été fonde, n'etoit pas J'ure, et ne voudroit pas recevoir temoignage.

I would have replied immediately to the former, because I thoroughly appreciate the courtesy and attention with which you have treated what I had the honor to write to you, and I should be very sorry to fail in making proper acknowledgment, but knowing that I would have occasion to write to you on the arrival of the child, who was at Troje's house, I decided to postpone it until now, in order to give you as little trouble as possible. At present, I have to acknowledge the delivery of the said child, and to advise you that I proceeded on the representations of the mother, who is married to a man named Piggot. I feel sure that a judgment has been rendered by the court of this district in favor of Trojé, but it is not in the office of the clerk of the court. Trojé does not deny that Piggot offered him payment in hogs or cattle, if he would come and take them to his house, notwithstanding the fact that the arbitrators on whose opinion the judgment was based, were not under oath, and would not take testimony. Trojé can collect any just claim which he may have for the support of the child, if he will take the trouble to sue for it in the court which is at present established, and it devolves on that court to decide controversies between private individuals. Apparently, this is the first time that a child has been assigned as security for a debt. There is nothing that could afford me more pleasure than to convince you how much I desire to establish the most perfect harmony and good understanding between the governments established on the two sides of the river, and with how much zeal I should like to support you in rendering justice to all, both foreigners and the inhabitants of the country, and I am happy to take the occasion to assure you that it is with the greatest respect that I have the honor, etc. [No date, 1790) MONSIEUR J’ai l’honeur devous addresser la presente parla quelle Je vous instruit que Jerenvoye sur votre rive la petite fille que le nomé droje ‘avoit en sa possession; l’ayant interrogé sur ce qui s'etoit passé dans le tems a cet égard il ma declaré que la cour du district des Cahos 1 Troge.avoit rendu un jugement en sa faveur, qui lui allouoit de la part des parents de l'enfant une certaine somme pour l'indemniser en partie de ses foins pendant le tems qu'elle a été en son pouvoir; * Je laisse a vos soins monsieur le succés du payement qui doit lui revenir, puis qu'il a été trouvé juste et équitable; et Je souhaite que le desir que J'ai de rendre justice a tout le monde tant de ceux de mon gouvernement que des etrangers lors qu'ils me la reclament puisse entretenir une union et une concorde respective.

MY DEAR SIR: In order to take cognizance of the subject of the claim in your favor of the 20th instant concerning the child who is today in the possession of Mr. Lajoye, I had the latter appear before me and from the questions which I put to him and the reasons which he advanced to me on this subject I have found in him only a disposition to render service to the Unhappy Father who lost him and who asks for him in a letter of which the said Mr. Lajoye is the bearer. After studying this matter carefully, I find that the above-mentioned child claimed by Mr. Mayet can leave the possession of Mr. Lajoye only to go to that of the Father now living at Natches. I think also that it is just for the said Mr. Mayet to be reimbursed for what he actually gave the savages in order to get him out of their barbarous hands; consequently it is proper that he settle Mr. Lajoye's account, and moderate it to a just and reasonable sum, in order to avoid abuses which might arise in the future: coureurs de bois and vagabonds in the hope of procuring means for themselves by such practices might excite the savages to the disorder to which, Unhappily, they are only too much inclined. I cannot refrain, Sir, from expressing to you my surprise when it appears that you could have believed that this child was a slave in the house of Mr. Lajoye! Would it be possible that a government which has ever protected the unfortunate, which is an enemy of tyranny and which makes it its boast that humanity and good order are observed in all the departments under it, could have permitted a young boy to be reduced to slavery who was so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of the savages and whose father is a subject of His Majesty; such criminal deeds are never committed in our Government and if any individuals dared to do them they would be severely punished. - When the young man arrived at Mr. Lajoye's house, he came and notified me of it at once and that he would write to the lower part of the Colony to learn in what district the Father of the said child lived. He learned later from the letter of which he is the bearer, that he resides at Natchez; accordingly he will send him down on the first opportunity. I have the honor to be with deep respect, Sir, Your very humble and obedient servant, MANUEL PEREZ MR. ARTHUR ST. CLAIR, Esquire, Governor General of the Western Territories of the United States of America.

SIR, The inhabitants of the Villages of the Cohos and Prairie du Pont take the Liberty of informing you that in Consequence of the Connection which you have been pleased to make of the Seigniory of the Cohos with the Domain of the States, in which are included the Lands and Commons set apart for their Cattle which they have possessed for several Years: which Lands you have led them to hope would be continued to them." It is found that, by adding this Seigniory to the Domain, they are deprived of a Sufficiency of Land on which to support their Cattle; and of wood not only for Building but for Fuel. It is for these Reasons, Sir, that they have recourse to your Clemency and bountiful Authority, that you may be pleased to grant them a sufficient Common surrounding their Lands, which shall commence by a Line drawn between the Land called Ottach at the End of the Morass along the Coasts, running at two Thirds of a League above the Coasts to the misissippi and taking the said Line above the Coasts in returning N. E. 4 North to the End of the Bounty Lands granted to them by Congress, and which are bounded by a strait Line drawn from the misissippi to that running two Miles above the Coasts. This small Portion of Land above the Coasts n'etent remplie d’entonoirs et bas fonds which render it unfit for Cultivation, at the same Time it is of great Utility to them on accº of the wood, which they cannot do without.” We request you Sir that when you shall be pleased to put us in Possession of the 400 Acres of Bounty Land which the Congress has granted to each Family, you will order a certain Breadth of Front in order to furnish each with 400 Acres from the misissippi to the Line which shall run two miles above the Coasts—observing that if these 400 Acres were given by a Square of 20 acres, some of them would be found to fall totally in Morass, others in wood, and others in meadow, and that each Person may suffer no Injury, lots may be cast for each parcel. - We, who are faithful Subjects of the United States, expect every Thing from your Equity.” COHOS 28.

MEMORIAL FROM FATHER GIBAULT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR [SF:1 Cong., 3 sess.: C is] No 24, Translation 1" [May 1, 1790) To his Excellency Arthur Sº Clair, Major General of the army of the United States, Governor of the Territory possessed by the United States North west of the River Ohio &c. &c. The undersigned memorialist has the honor to represent to your Excellency. That from the moment of the conquest of the Illinois by Colonel George Roger Clark, he has not been backward in venturing his life on the many occasions in which he found that his presence was useful and sometimes necessary. And at all times sacrificing his property, which he gave for the support of the Troops at the same price that he could have received in spanish dollars, and for which however he has received only paper dollars, of which he has had no information since he sent them addressed to the Commissioner of Congress, who required a Statement of the depreciation of them at the Belle Rivière in 1783, with an express promise in reply, that particular attention should be paid to his account because it was known to be no way exaggerated. In reality he parted with his Tithes and his Beasts only to set an example to his Parishioners, who began to perceive that it was intended to pillage them and abandon them afterwards, which really took place. The want of seven thousand eight hundred Livres, of which the non payment of the american notes has deprived him the use, has obliged him to sell two good Slaves who would now be the support of his old age, and for the want of whom he now finds himself dependent on the public, who although well served, are very rarely led to keep their promises, except that part, who, employing his time in their service, are supported by the secular power, that is to say, by the civil Government. The love of his Country and of liberty have also led the memorialist to reject all the advantages offered to him by the Spanish Government. And he endeavoured by every means in his power, by exertions and exhortations, and by letters to the principal inhabitants, to retain every person under the Dominion of the United States, in expectation of better times, and giving them to understand that our lives and property being employed twelve years in the aggrandisement and preservation of the conquests of the united States, would at last receive an acknowledgment and be compensated by the enlightened is This document was enclosure no. 4 in the report of the Secretary of State, Feb. 17, 1791 (A.S.P., Pub. Lands, 1, 18–22), and enclosure no. 24 in that of St. Clair, Feb. 10, 1791, post, p. 335. 1° The original has not been found; the translation is contemporary.and upright Ministers who sooner or later would come to examine into, and relieve us from our sad situation. We begin to see the accomplishment of these hopes, under the happy Government of your Excellency, and as your Memorialist has reason to believe, from proofs which would be too long to explain here, one of the number who has been the most forward in risking his life and fortune for his country.” He also hopes that his demand will be listened to favorably. It is this. The missionaries, like Lords, have at all times possessed two Tracts of land near this village, one three acres in front which produces but little Hay, three quarters being useless by a great morass— the other of two acres in front, which may be cultivated, and which the Memorialist will have cultivated with care, and proposes to have a Dwelling erected on it, with a Garden and Orchard, in case his claim is accepted. Your Excellency may think perhaps that this might injure some of the inhabitants; but it will not. It would be difficult to hire them to cause an enclosure to be made of the size of these Tracts, so much land have they more than they can cultivate. May it please your Excellency then to grant them to the memorialist as belonging to the Domain of the United States, and to give him a Concession to be enjoyed in full propriety in his private name, and not as to a missionary and Priest to pass to his successor, otherwise the memorialist, not wishing to labour for others, would not accept it. It is for the services he has already rendered and those which he still hopes to render as far as circumstances may offer and he may be capable, and particularly on the bounty with which you relieve those who stand in need of assistance, that he founds his demand. In hopes of being soon of the number of those who praise Heaven for your fortunate arrival in this Country, and who desire your prosperity in every thing, your memorialist has the honor of being with the most profound respect " Your Excellency's Most obedient and Most humble Servant P.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, CAHOKIA May 10, 1790 SIR I have this day communicated to the Secretary of the Department of War” all the Intelligence respecting the Indian Affairs thathas come to my knowledge and Observation since I wrote to him before,” and I am very sorry to have it to remark, that they do not wear a very favorable Complexion:-That the Ouabash Indians should have taken the Resolution to be guided entirely by those of the Miami Willage, is nearly tantamount to a declaration that they will continue their Hostilities; *—if Matters come to that Issue, there can certainly be no hesitation about employing force to reduce them to reason, and I hope the Legislature will not boggle at the Expense, be it what it may; for it is certainly better for a Nation, in every Case, to incur Expense, whatever may be its difficulties, than to lose Reputation: and should the Savages be suffered to insult the Government, and murder and rob the People with impunity, its credit would be lowered, very much, both with foreign Nations and its own Citizens.—the quietly putting up with one Injury seldom fails to prepare the way for the offering another. My Time, since my Arrival in this Country, has been chiefly taken up with the receiving and examining the Claims of the Inhabitants, which have been presented very slowly;” partly from their extreme Ignorance, and partly from their total want of the English Language:— The Secretary being little accouainted with the french, I had required a State of their Claims in English; but as not a fiftieth Man can either read or write any Language, I was obliged to dispense with that, and interpret between him and them myself. The People are reduced to the lowest Ebb of Poverty—for four Years successively the Country has been laid under Water (for the french Settlements are all in the low Grounds or River Prairies, which are very extensive.) which destroyed much the greatest part of their crops in each of those Years; and the last Season a Frost in the beginning of September destroyed nearly all their Corn—They were so much discouraged that, had my Arrival been much longer delayed, the Country would have been abandonned alltogether; perhaps] what had the principal Effect in preventing it was, that on the Spanish side the Lands are naturally less fertile, and had suffered nearly as much from the Innundations: The Spirit of Industry, which however they never possess in any great Degree, seems to be reviving, and as the Season advances [margin torn] happily, and they are naturally of a sanguine temper, and look fondly [for]ward to better times, their Misfortunes will I hope beforgotten.— I have been trying to persuade some of them to quit their Willages, where as Farmers they can never thrive, and establish themselves upon on Plantations in the higher Lands, for the Prariries are every where bounded by a steep and high Bank, at the foot of which it is very evident that the Missisippi has sometime run, but they have so perfect a dread of the Savages, that, tho' they are satisfied of the truth of it, it is impossible to bring them to attempt it; tho the high Lands are both fertile and Healthy, and the Indian Commerce, which was the Resource of their Willages, has entirely forsaken them:-I suspect however they dread the Timber, with which it is covered, almost as much as the Savages; having never been accustomed to the clearing or cultivating timbered Lands. If some of the great number of Families that are daily descending the Missisippi, and are, for a time at least, lost to their Country, could be diverted this Way, they would find a Country which would abundantly supply them with all the Necessaries and many of the Conveniences of Life, and without a great deal of Labor; for, even in the interior Country, far from the great Rivers, there are abundance of extensive Prairies, where there is nothing to do but to enclose them and put in the Plough—the Habits of Industry and the knowledge of Husbandry would from them be communicated to the ancient Inhabitants.--I do not know whether the design to dispose of this Country, in small Quantities to People who would settle it, has been resumed by Congress or not; but of this I am certain that, while the rage of Emigration continues, it would be good Policy to discharge a part of it here, where the People would become good Subjects, and form an effectual Barrier against future contingencies:–neither is it by any means improbable that when the Advantages which this Country offer come to be generally known, they may turn this Way of themselves, and establish themselves without Authority; if not in the face of it; which would introduce a Spirit of Licentiousness, hitherto unknown here, that might not be very easily repressed. The Judges are not yet arrived neither have I the least information about them:-their Absence has embarrased me a good Deal, as many Regulations, suited to the peculiar Circumstances of this part of the Country are necessary, and cannot, with propriety be established but by Law; I have been obliged however, in some Instances, to take it upon myself, after waiting for them as long as possible, and direct them by Proclamation—I have no doubt of a ready Obedience, for it is the mode to which the People are habituated, but I am sensible, that in so doing, I have gone beyond my proper Powers.”—My Excuse Sir I hope will be found in the necessity of the Case, and as the Good of the People only was in View, I cannot doubt but Laws willconfirm them as soon as possible.”—One of these Proclamations respects a County which I have erected here.” The Settlements are three principal (MS. torn] Cahokia, the Prairie du Rochers and Kaskaskia, with some sm[all] ones—not one of those contain a sufficient number of People [MS. torn) its being a separate County, (indeed in the whole Country taken [MS. torn] have been very much put to it to find proper Subjects to fill the different Offices) and they are at too great a Distance from each other, in present Circumstances, for any two of them to have been joined, I was therefore obliged to divide the County into Districts, and to direct Sessions of each of the Courts to be held in each District, and the Records to be kept in them in the same manner as if they had been distinct Counties:–It will be attended with the Inconvenience to one or two of the Magistrates to go to the different Places but it was impossible to concenter the Business of the whole, and confine the Courts to one Place, without putting an entire stop to the Administration of Justice. In a Letter, which I had the honor to address to you from the Rapids of Ohio, I mentioned the Information I had received respecting Mº Morgan in that part of the Country.—I found that he had been still busier here, if possible: in order to induce the Inhabitants to abandon the Country and follow him, he had a number of Sacks of Earth brought up from the Ance de la Graise,” to shew them, and convince them of its very superior Quality; but his chief Argument, and that which operated most powerfully, was drawn from that Article in the Constitution of the Territory which respects Slaves.— he assured them, most positively, that they would all be liberated without any Compensation being made to the owners—He pressed them to save them while it was yet in their Power—that the Governor was then on his way, and after his arrival it would be too late—to fly if they had any regard to themselves—they had not a moment to lose:-it had the Effect to drive away many respectable Inhabitants, but not the Effect he expected, very few followed him, but they took refuge on the opposite Shore and became Subjects of Spain, which they now very heartily regret—He is now at this Moment sending away the Inhabitants of New Jersey to that Country under printed Passports directed to all civil and military Officers and requiring them to receive them as Subjects of his Catholic Majesty. Major Doughty was shewn one of those by the commanding Officer at the Ance de la Graise, who did not however very cordially accept the Greeting. By the Ordinance for establ[ish]ing the Indian Department” the Superintendant is empowered to appoint two Deputies and a Salary of five hundred Dollars is annexed to the Appointment—Two Deputies, should a good Understanding be brought about with the Indians, is not sufficient [for] this extensive District, and I believe the Salary might safely be ſlow]ered—Persons equally capable and worthy of trust might be got I think for one half the Sum; for five hundred Dollars will not call off any Persons of much consequence from their other Pursuits, whereas to a Person who has nothing but a farm to attend to, the half of it is a considerable Object—four Deputies would not be found too many, tho hitherto I have appointed but One—but it will not be long before more will be necessary.— While I am speaking of Salarys wiſll you] permit me Sir to mention that of the Governor—I do assure you Sir it is a very inadequate One, and I was sensible of it before I took the Office upon me—I supposſed that a little management would have secured an increase of it at the last Session of Congress, but where Money was the Object I would never in my life make use of any on my own Account—Whoever undertakes it after me will find that it will by no means support him, in the manner that will be expected, and which the Dignity of Government requires—it is even necessary that a little Splendor should be thrown round it.—This is however the most expensive Country in the World—Money they have none, and European Goods, which are at an excessive Price, is the Measure of that, and of everything else—Money is the Measure of no one thing—even Linnen cannot be got washed under three Dollars the dozen Pieces.—besides the Person who will be sent to this] Country in the Capacity of Governor must make some Sacrifices, for which he may reasonably expect some Indemnification, independent of the long and dangerous Journies he must necessarily make both by Land and Water.—My Salary I am confident will not support me; and yet I am as careful I think as I can be without Meaness. With the most earnest Wishes for your Health and Happiness and the prosperity of the Country under your Government, and with the greatest Respect and Attachment I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient and very humble Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES P. S. I have thought proper to explain the Article respecting Slaves as a prohibition to any future introduction of them, but not to extend to the liberation of those the People were already possessed of, and accouired under the Sanction of the Laws they were subject, at the same time I have given them to understand that Steps would probably be taken for the gradual Abolition of Slavery, with which they seem perfectly satisfied.”  From His Excy Gov" Sº Clair May 1º 1790

MY DEAR SIR: The inhabitants who constitute the two villages and district of Cahos take the liberty of advising Your Excellency that they feel obliged to request you kindly to put a stop to and make a decision concerning the enterprise undertaken by Mr. Pierre Gibault, a priest holding a power of attorney from the missionaries of Quebec, for a sale as illicit as it is underhand in character of the greater part of the real property of the undersigned, which he has taken the precaution to conceal from them by imposing on the credulity of Mr. Treeck to whom he has sold our said property under the futile disguise of a pretended power of attorney which he gave Mr. Treack to understand authorized him to sell our property. We request Your Excellency kindly to examine the authority conferred on Mr. Gibault in this power of attorney and we do not doubt that your intelligence will perceive a cupidity and hardness of heart which have caused Mr. Gibault to wish to deprive us of our property, which we have had to sweat blood to establish. As this sale is in every point unfair, obreptitious, and made by Mr. Gibault without any authority or personal qualification, a secret and wrongful sale, tending to deprive us of our property in the most iniquitous manner, he has manifestly defrauded the inhabitants and citizens of this district. Mr. Treack and others, having in good faith arrived at the actual belief that Mr. Gibault had the right to sell our said property, we have recourse to the equity and authority of Your Excellency, with the request that you yourself decide as to the validity or invalidity of this pretended sale, by causing Mr. Gibault to appear before your tribunal, or other court of this district which you may see fit to designate, before the departure of Your Excellency, for the annulment of the sale which he, as a fraudulent seller, made on an insufficient basis to Mr. Treack, and leave to us the free enjoyment and possession of the lands of which he wished to deprive us, by his fraudulent sale to Mr. Treack, subject to the recourse of Mr. Treack or others to whom this pretended sale has been transferred against Mr. Gibault or against the seminary which conferred its powers upon him—powers which have been annulled by the conquest of this country by the United States, as well as to sentence Mr. Gibault to pay all the costs of the judgments to be rendered in this district, by means of the annulment of this sale. We await the satisfaction of our just demands by Your Excellency, at Cahos, May 12, 1790.

Clair Esq’ Governor and Commander in Chief of the Territory of the United States North west of the River Ohio. We your Petitioners beg leave to represent to your Excellency the state and circumstances of a number of distressed but faithful subjects of the United States of America, wherein we wish to continue and that under your immediate Government; But unless our principal agrievance can be removed by your Excellency's encouragement, we shall despair of holding a residence in the State we love. The Indians who have not failed one year in four past to kill our people, steal our horses and at times have killed and drove off numbers of our horned Cattle, render it impossible for us to live in the Country any way butin Forts or Villages, which we find very sickly in the Missisippi bottom. Neither can we cultivate our land but with a guard of our inhabitants equipt with arms, nor have we more Tilable land for the support of seventeen families than what might be easily Tilled by four of us, and as those lands whereon we live are the property of two individuals, it is uncertain how long we may enjoy the scanty privileges we have here; Nor do we find by your Excellency's Proclamation * that those of us which are the major part, who came to the Country since the year 1783 are entitled to the land we improved at the risk of our lives, with a design to live on. Those with many other difficulties which your Excellency may be better informed of by our Reverend friend M* James Smith, hath very much gloomed the aspect of a number of the free & loyal subjects of the United States. In consideration of which your Petitioners humbly request, that by your Excellency's command there may be a Village with inlots and outlots sufficient for families to subsist on laid out and established in or near the Prairie de Moriway we know the other american settlers near the Missisippi to be in equal deplorable circumstances with ourselves, and consequently would be equally benefited by the privileges we ask; and that those of us that came to the Country and improved land since the year 1783 may be confirmedinaright of pre-emption to their improvements, is the humble request of your petitioners; and we as in duty bound shall ever pray “James Piggot * Lenard Harnes W* Biggs.

Before me Arthur Sº Clair Governor of the territory of the United States, north west of the Ohio personally appeared Joseph La Bussiere, and being duly sworn, did declare that the above writing made by him, and subscribed with his own hand, contains the truth, and nothing but the truth to the best of his memory, and recollection. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal at Cahokia the 29th day of May 1790. A' Sº Clair. (L.S.) [Translation] I, the undersigned, former royal notary under the French Government, at the request of Mr. St. Clair, Governor of the Illinois country and dependencies, certify on my oath that about thirty-three or thirtyfour years ago, by order of Major Macarty, commander of the Illinois country, and of Mr. Buchet, commissioner of that country, I went to Cahos from my residence at Fort Chartre, in order to publish at Cahos on a Sunday at the door of the church a declaration of the King, which forbade the Cahos missionaries to sign in the future or give any concession of lands to anybody whomsoever, and ordered those who had concessions from such missionaries to return them to Fort Chartre in order that others might be given to them in the name of the King, and the said declaration annuls such concessions, as well as all seignorial titles given by the commanders to the said missionaries, as it was the intention of His Majesty that there should be no seigneur in his colony of Louisiana other than himself; and forbids the said missionaries to assume the status of seigneur in the future, which I certify to be the substance of the said declaration, the exact terms of which I do not recall, owing to the number of years which have elapsed. I [certify that] I read the said declaration as published and posted at the door of the church of the said locality of Cahos at the close of the parochial mass, and that the original thereof has remained in the possession of Mr. Macarty or of Mr. Buchet. I further certify that I have heard it said by persons in authority of that time that the missionaries had made vain attempts to have their title of concession ratified by the French court, and that they had never succeeded in doing so. That is what I am able to recall to mind. In faith whereof I have given this document to Governor St. Clair to use as he sees fit. Cahos, May 29, 1790. LA BUSSIERE.

MEMORIAL OF FATHER GIBAULT AND OTHERS TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  (Nº 6) Translation [June 9, 1790) To his Excellency Arthur Sº Clair Esq’ Governor and Commander in § of the Territory of the United States North West of the River Ohio. The Memorial of the Inhabitants of Kaskaskia, la Prairie du Rocher and Cahokia, County of Sº Clair. - Humbly sheweth That by an Act of the Congress of 20° June 1788,” it was declared that the lands theretofore possessed by the said inhabitants should be surveyed at their expense, and that this clause appears to them neither necessary nor adapted to quiet the minds of the people. It does not appear necessary, because from the establishment of the Colony to this day, they have enjoyed their property and possessions without disputes or law suits on the subject of their limits; that the Surveys of them were made at the time the concessions were obtained from their ancient Kings, Lords, or Commandants; and that each of them knew what belonged to him, without attempting an encroachment on his neighbour, or fearing that his neighbour would encroach on him. It does not appear adapted to pacify them, because instead of assuring to them the peaceable possession of their ancient inheritances, as they have enjoyed it till now, that clause obliges them to bear expences, which in their present situation, they are absolutely incapable of paying, and for the failure of which they must be deprived of their lands. Your Excellency is an Eyewitness of the poverty to which the inhabitants are reduced, and of the total want of provisions to subsist on. Not knowing where to find a morsel of bread to nourish their families, by what means can they support the expence of a survey which has not been sought for on their parts, and for which it is conceived by them there is no necessity? Loaded with misery and groaning under the weight of misfortunes, accumulated since the virginia Troops entered their Country, the unhappy inhabitants throw themselves under the protection of your Excellency, and take the liberty to solicit you to lay their deplorable situation before Congress. And as it may be interesting for the united States to know exactly the extent and limits of their ancient possessions, in order to ascertain the lands which are yet at the disposal of Congress, it appears to them, in their humble opinion, that the expence of survey ought more properly to be borne by Congress for whom alone it is useful, than by them who do not feel the necessity of it. Besides this is no object for the united States; but it is great, too great for a few unhappy beings who your Excellency sees yourself are scarcely able to support their pitiful existence. To these motives they venture to add that of the generosity worthy of a great people: the taking upon them a burthen too heavy for a small number of unhappy individuals will give lustre to their dignity. They venture to hope that the paternal goodness of your Excellency towards your adopted Children will induce you to present their humble supplication to the honorable Congress, and that you will second it with your protection.” They will ever pray to heaven for the preservation and prosperity of your Excellency.” COUNTY OF St CLAIR June 9th 1790 P: Gibault. ptre.” J" Dumoulin Clemand X Trotia 90 Augustrotie "" Louis Lebrun Veuve Beaulieu Michele Beaulieux Pierre La 98 Henry Biron * Charles X Codron 1 P: Billett.” Barbau.

F. BOSSERON AND OTHERS TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT 43a  No 9. [July 3, 1790) To the Honorable Winthrop Sargent Esquire Secretary in and for the Territory of the United States North West of the River Ohio, and wested with all the Powers of Governor and Commander in Chief— SIR. As you have given verbal orders to the Magistrates who formerly composed the Court of the District of Post Vincennes under the Jurisdiction of the State of Virginia, to give you their Reasons for having taken upon them to grant Concessions for Lands within the District, We beg leave in obedience thereto to inform you that their principal Reason is, That since the Establishment of this Country, the Commondants have always appeared to be vested with the powers to give Lands. Their Founder Mº Vincennes began to give Concessions, and all his Successors have given Lands and Lots. Mº Legras was appointed Commandant of Post Vincennes by the Lieutenant of the County and Commander in Chief John Todd, who was in the Year 1779 sent by the State of Virginia for to regulate the Government of the Country, and who substituted Mº Legras with his Powers; In his Absence M* Legras who was then Commandant, affirmed that he had in Quality of Commandant Authority to give Lands, according to the antient Usages of other Commanders, and he verbally informed the Court of Post Vincennes that when they would judge it proper to give Lands or Lots to those who should come into the Country to settle or otherwise, they might do it and that he gave them permission so to do—These are the Reasons that we acted upon; and if we have done more than we ought, it was on Account of the little Knowledge which we had of public Affairs “–We are with the greatest Respect—Your Honors Most Obedient and very humble Servants F: BOSSERON 45 L: E: DELINE PIERRE GAMELIN 4" PIERRE X QUEREZ POST VINCENNES 3rd July 1790 Marque 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO SECRETARY SARGENT [MHS: Sargent Papers: C "] FORT STEUBEN,” July 6th, 1790 DEAR SIR:—I have been favoured with your letters” by Major Wyllis who arrived at this place one day before me. Our journey was well enough this far, tho’ not so expeditious as I had expected, and wished extremely.” The delays I have met with since have been intolerable. At last, however, we get off and the big boat is left for you. As yet she is not got over the Falls, the water being in an unfavorable state, both too high and too low. I have directed Mr. Buntin * to forward the Indian things, but I fear they cannot reach you in time. It was, however, impossible to send them from the mouth of the Ouabash as had been proposed, as there was no boat there, and it would have been attended with some difficulties if there had been one there. The instructions to Mr. Todd which you desire a copy of I cannot come at, but they are silent on the subject of the lands,” and the act of assembly was to continue in force for one year only—whether it expired by its own limitations or was re-enacted, I know not.” Mr. Todd was appointed the County Lieutenant and empowered to make the necessary appointments, civil and military, and those were, all his powers. The grants that have been made by him, and by the courts appear to me to have been altogether unauthorized, and I have uniformly rejected all the concessions made by the courts.” I should have been happy to have met with the judges, but as they are with you and you know perfectly the regulations that are wanted, I hope no delay in providing them will arise from our missing each other. I beg the favour that you will present my compliments and I shall write to them by the first opportunity from Fort Washington—to Mr. Baird," also, if you please; and to Major Hamtramck. It is impossible for me to write here at this time having been more plagued and vexed than ever I was in the same time in my life, and delayed almost a week when the utmost expedition was necessary. I wish you health and a safe return, and am, dear Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, A. ST. CLAIR THE HONORABLE WINTHROP SARGENT, Esq., Secretary of the Western Territory, Post St. Vincennes.

I do not know what their numbers are, neither do I expect that this letter will find you there.—I wish you however to send orders to the officer in command of them to join Major Hamtramack with so many as make his effective Force five hundred Men, which will not require above one hundred, in which I would hope there will be no difficulty.—I set out this day for the Country above to get on the Pennsylvania Quota, and shall pass to New York and back so as to be here by the time the Expedition moves when I hope to have the pleasure to meet you, and am with very great regard Dear Sir Your most obedient Servant A* St. CLAIR

JUDGE PUTNAM TO THE PRESIDENT  NEW YORK July 24th 1790 SIR I left Muskingum the 2" instent; northing new in that quarter Sence Mr Morgan came on, except, that a number of Horses have ben Stolen & one man killed at Bellevill (a Virginia Settlement about three miles below the great Hockhocking) which appears to be a Misschief altogather unprovoked. Also about the 28* of last month a woman was taken neer the mouth of Buffaloe Creek, and was afterward murdered, but this business was prefaced by the white people Stealing a number of Horses from the the Indians & refuseing to deliver them up when demanded.
The Muskingum Settlements have lost many Horses, the last fall & this Sumer, Some Stollen by white people but more by the Indians, and their is Sufficient evidence that Some of the Dellawares and Wyndots who attended the Treaty at Fort Harmer, as well as the Shawona’es have ben concerned in the thieft—their is also good reason to beleve that Several belonging to the Dellaware & Wyndot Nations, have ben concerned in Murdering the people and plundering the boats, going down the ohio; the last Winter and Spring, & it is likewise Said, that a number of White men ware among that Gang of robbers. It Seems that they are possessed of Some boats or other Craft on the Sioto, in which they Issue out of that river into the ohio, and haveing obtained their booty retire again with Saifty—would not a Small Detachment of Troops Stationed at the mouth of the Sioto in great measure, if not wholly, put a Stop to this kind of business, and at the Same time give confidence to the people in the new Settlements on the the ohio, which are commenceing betwen the Sioto and the Great Kenhawa— By letters recived at Muskingum from M* Secretary Sargent, and also from Major Doughtys information: I learnt that Govenor Sº Clair was Still in the Illinois Country & would not, probably, return to Muskingum till october, & that Misieur" Syms & Turner, left the Miamis in the month of May to attend the Govenor—Under these circumstancs I concived it best to to return imedately for my family.

ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE PRESIDENT  VINCENNES 29* July 1790 SIR Mº Joseph Sº Marie a Citizen of Vincennes of good Character, has made Representation to me of a Seizure upon his Property by an Officer of his Catholic Majesty, and within what is understood to be the Territory of the united States—which I beg Leave to lay before your Excellency *— with very great Respect I have the Honour to be your Excellency's most Humble & devoted Servant WINTHROP SARGENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE PRESIDENT, VINCENNES, COUNTY OF KNOX August 1” 1790– SIR By the Conveyance for my Official Communications I beg Leave to represent,” that the Act of the United States which authorises & directs the Secretary of their Western Territory to discharge (at certain Times) the Duties of the Governour * has involved me in additional Expenses, Which they have not as yet been pleased to provide for, And which my private Finances do not capacitate me to defray— It is to me Sir a most painful Task to make any Representations that may imply a pecuniary Request for myself—but situated as I am it becomes incumbent upon me. In the Office of the Secretary, Advances of Money have been made by me for Stationary, Printing, Public Seal &c" (and for some of those Articles have again become necessary) whilst all my Applications for a Reimbursement, to the Board of Treasury, have been passed by in Silence—To the Duties of this Office as pointed out & defined by the Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of July 1787—I found myself fully competent, but circumstanced as we now are, & divided into many Counties & Districts, all of which are to be furnished with Copies of the Laws, Proclamations & Ordinances of the Governour, the Writings have consequently become so multiplied that no one Person, tho’ devoting his whole Time, can be adequate to performing them—And in Addition to all this Sir, I am informed by Governour Sº Clair that it is expected I should consider myself as Secretary to the Indian Commission—a Business which in the Western Territory will probably for a long Time demand much Attention. I will beg Leave Sir to observe upon this Matter that when Congress established the Offices of Governour & Secretary, the Superintendency of Indian Affairs was in a third Person—and that at the Time they were pleased to bestow this upon the Governour,” they increased his Salary–May I not therefore Sir reasonably presume that some further Provision should also be made for my Office if, contrary to the original System, it is to comprehend & include the Records of Indian Business? for tho' I would not by any Means ask or expect a Sinecure from Government yet I assure myself that I may with Propriety request such a Salary as shall enable me to discharge my Duty with Fidelity, & Reputation to myself "– Upon all those Subjects generally, I believe Sir it is the Intention of Governour Sº Clair to express himself at this Time, if the Importance of more Public Concerns shall leave him Opportunity—but the Expenses which I must necessarily incur by his present Absence is a Matter that has arisen therefrom And probably may escape his Attention—this Subject therefore as well as the Advances I have been necessitated to make I will beg Leave to lay before Congress by this Opportunity— Most respectfully asking that they would be pleased to order for me such Provision as they may deem meet— with every Sentiment of the highest Respect I have the Honour to be Sir your most obedient devoted Servant WINTHROP SARGENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

SECRETARY SARGENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR, FORT STEUBEN, RAPIDS OF OHIO August 17th 1790 MY DEAR SIR I have been favoured with yours dated at this Post & Fort Washington & have given Instructions to the commands Officer of Vincennes agreeably to your Desire. My Official Communications to the President of the United States which accompany this Letter will inform you of my Proceedings in the County of Knox *— Although the Judges have been with me for a long Time past, & I was not ignorant that much remained for us to do, yet very little has been done, which as it respects myself I feel to be a great Misfortune & Unhappiness, but not a Fault"—Some Regulations which I conceived to be very necessary should have been made by my own Authority but from a well founded Apprehension that such Authority might be questioned in a Manner injurious to Government—Your Excellency, I understand has expected that a general Court would have been held at Sº Clair & Knox Counties, but I could not reconcile it to my Ideas of Delicacy to your Character to alter the Law upon that Head —and for which I would have adduced no better Reason than the private Accommodation of the Judges—Had it been otherwise they could not have proceeded, for no provision is as yet made by the Contractors for their Escort—and even major Hamtramck's Garrison will I am persuaded suffer for the Want of Bread. I have paid Gamelins Account (200 Dollars)" & request you to make arrangements with Col Platt" that it may be reimbursed to Major Jackson who advanced the money, or otherwise the Bill drawn upon the Occasion will be protested. I have been under the Necessity of borrowing Indian Goods from the Contractors Store at Vincennes & of Mº Vigo7 to make some Presents to the Ouiatanons, the Circumstances of whom you are acquainted with—Mº Bunting * promises me to replace those Articles  by some Opportunity—& I hope my Conduct may meet your Excellency's Approbation. It is I assure you Sir with much Pleasure I have been informed of your safe arrival at Fort Washington, for I was for a long Time very apprehensive for your Safety—The yellow Rascals of Langville sent us Word at Vincennes that they had three good Fires upon you at blue River, but it has proved to have been a Boat of Mº Vigo's which was there defeated, & again in ascending the Oubashe, in Company with Lieu. Melcher, he was attacked, possessed & plundered of every thing but Peltry—M" Melcher visited L'anie a la graisse." By Numbers of Traders from Detroit I am even persuaded that the British have for some Purposes of late been engaged in many private Councils with the Indians—They have made them as large Presents as they were ever known to do at any Time even in War–And Elliot " who acts under the Authority of Government has assured the Indians at River a la Roche upon the Mississippi & Lake Mischigan that they may have as many Goods as will fill the Otter Lake— 'Tis said that some of the Chiefs of the Creeks & Cherokees have lately been at Detroit—and there can be no Doubt that a very great Meeting of Warriors took Place at the Miamis Town upon the 9" Instant—All those Scoundrels now Sir profess to hold the Americans in the most supreme Degree of Contempt—They will they say send their Women to fight us & with Sticks instead of Guns—but I flatter myself they may be chastised into other Sentiments—the advanced State of the Season is however in their Favour; & they will undoubtedly have it in their Power to gather & hide their Corn before War can be carried into their Country— Should they Sir instead of running away (which I little suspect) fight as men in their Situation ought to do—it appears to me, from the past Conduct of the Kentuckey militia that they will absolutely take themselves off—We know how their Officers are appointed & from repeated Experiments how little Dependence can be placed in them. You will pardon I hope my Dear Sir the Liberty of those Suggestions.—I mentioned to your Excellency when you quitted Kaskaskias that in Case of any military operations I hoped to be employed, & I will only add that 'twill be more than a little mortifying to me if I should be altogether neglected— With the highest respect & esteem I have the Honor to be Your Excellency's most obedient Humble Servant W SARGENT I expect to proceed on in a Day or two for Fort Washington with a Light Boat—the Judges are expected here from Vincennes by Water, for Judge Symmes would not be prevailed upon to remain there for the October Term—The Schooner still below—her Decks entirely ruined & twill be necessary her Bottom should be recaulked before she can be made any Use of Would it be eligible to try to sew her?—  W.

JUDGES SYMMES AND TURNER TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  LOUISVILLE the 20th Aug 1790. SIR While at Vincennes we did ourselves the honor of informing you that as the public affairs of the territory required of the legislative branch of Government some attention to the passing of such laws as were highly necessary, we were content to spend some weeks longer at that place for the purpose if convenient to you— We again beg leave Sir to assure you that we are willing and it is now our wish to spend a few days at Fort Stueben or Clarkesville * for the purpose of effecting so important a part of our duty, and shall be happy if it may be agreeable to You, the more especially as your honor was pleased this day to communicate to each of us that you had lately received intimation by letter from his Excellency Governor St Clair that some very important laws were necessary to be passed in the territory which demanded our immediate attention * You Sir was pleased further to mention to one of us (M* Turner) that you thought it would be difficult for him to follow you to Fort Harmar as the public operations would probably be such as to render every mode of conveyance impracticable. If military movements render it necessary for M" Prior * to proceed tomorrow, You sir with your baggage can be well accommodated in the boat commanded by Capt Mercer in which Mº Turner returns to Fort Washington If this proposition should be found inadmissible with you and you sir effect another seperation by leaving us we cannot be responsible for consequenses as every path is attended with eminent danger from the savages, waiving the circumstance of sickness to which we are all liable.

JUDGES SYMMES AND TURNER TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  LOUISVILLE August 22° 1790 1/2 past 1 o'clock pm. SIR, Your letter of this morning, we had the honour to receive an hour ago, but as the matter of it is no less “unexpected” to us than that of our's appears to have been to you, we are induced to offer a few words in reply. When we take a retrospective view of the difficulties which have, in some instances, hitherto lain in the way of effecting certain measures which we deemed and still deem essential, as well to the public service as to the discharge of our duty, both as judges and legislators; it cannot, we concieve be “improper” in us to embrace every opportunity that offers towards effecting such measures. At present the Territory may be said to be, in a manner, without laws; for such as have already been past are so few in number, that the least possible reflection must convince you, they are extremely inadequate to form a ground work for the full administration of justice. The common law, alone, will not answer.” We should have been happy if it had suited your convenience while at Vincennes, to have complied as well with our own wishes as those of the judges of the inferior courts established there by your proclamation,” as expressed by their petition,” praying that a fee bill might be passed before the legislative authority should leave the place. We had frequently before urged the necessity of such a bill; but it was not till those magistrates petitioned, that your honour was pleased to yield consent. But having afterwards told us that your presence was highly necessary at the Rapids, and as the time assigned for your departure thence was by far too near to permit such a law to be made, unless other acts then in hand were to be laid aside, both our and the petitioners' hopes were at once frustrated.  We would wish to recal also to your memory the Fence law, which after having undergone many alterations (for we have always aimed at a spirit of accommodation) and been fairly engrossed in order to be passed, was equally unfortunate in being deprived of your signature.” These are but a very few of the considerations which induced our communication of yesterday You are pleased to say that “no public business can delay us here” (at therapids). You happen to be right as affects the present moment; but in making the assertion, you might have been mistaken—since the occurring duties of the judges are best known to themselves, and are not confined to the legislating and holding of courts alone. The ordinance providing for the government of this Territory is silent on many points with respect to the powers and duties of the principal officers.--Whenever this happens to be the case, we can only be governed by the obvious implication, or the general usages of the states in similar cases. Now admitting, that the power of calling together at any time and at any place in any one year the legislative authority of the Territory, is vested in the governour; yet we concieve there would be an acknowledged impropriety in requiring them to assemble at one place for the purpose of legislating at another—Nor do we think it either reasonable or proper that three officers of government should make a tour of some hundreds of miles to visit one officer, when he, as but one person, might more easily come to the other three. Besides, Sir, the legislature is sufficiently “complete.” without the addition of a fourth person: it would not, indeed, be so [MS. torn]” We have the honour to [MS. torn) Sir, with great respect Your obedient humble Servants JOHN CLEVES SYMMES. G. TURNER THE HONble W. SARGENT esq [Addressed] The hon” Winthrop Sargent esquire Secretary of the W. Tery Fort Steuben  Judge Symmes August 1790 Rec" this Letter 4 o'Clock 20 m” Sunday 224 August & just as I was embarking to ascend River— The Fence Law mentioned to have been engrossed ready for signing was objectionable as not having the Fences particularly enough described & in taking away a Mans Property for private Roads without making for him a proper Compensation which was mentioned repeatedly to the Judges & an alteration consented to, but never having been made it could not receive my Signature”— 
JUDGE TURNER TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT, CINCINNATI, Septem: 2, 1790 SIR, I have to acknowledge the receipt of two letters from you; one of the 30th ult”,” the other of the 1* instant,” which last I received this morning. The former which being addressed to Mº Symmes, jointly with myself in the absence of that gentleman, (and who has not yet appeared) I must decline replying to it at present. As to the letter of yesterday, I shall beg leave to submit here a few words in answer: they will be few, indeed, as I find my hands arrested by this official communication at a moment when employed in the very act of packing up my baggage in order to proceed myself to Marietta. I need not tell you, Sir, that the judges are the guardians of the laws, and cannot, without violating their consciences and trust, suffer any act or authority to be exercised within their jurisdiction, unknown to the Constitution and laws of the land. I found on my arrival at this place your proclamation posted up for giving effect on the fourth instant to two laws, which cannot possibly operate before the first day of January next. Of course, any proclamation to the contrary is founded on no lawful authority, and might involve unwary magistrates in consequences of a very disagreeable nature. I should think it my indispensible duty to bring every magistrate to punishment, who should presume to act under such a proclamation.” Motives of humanity, as well as duty, induced me to express my opinion to Mr Justice M*Millan:* And, Sir, you will always find me ready to maintain that opinion upon principles consonant to law. My conduct on this and every other occasion, I shall submit, with the greatest cheerfulness, to the strictest scrutiny whenever it may be lawfully demanded. I have chosen thus to counteract the evils which magistrates might incur, as a mode the most delicate towards yourself, out of other means that are within my power: and so far from exciting your displeasure, I hoped it would have merited your approbation. For after an attempt so derogatory to the legislative authority of this Territory, it surely did not become me to make any personal remonstrance to yourself. But while I am so unfortunate as to differ with you in opinion as to some essentials respecting our public duties, give me leave, sir, to say, that it will always afford me the highest gratificat" as well to cherish the personal esteem I have long entertained for you, as to see the respective powers of the several officers of government well understood, and as well maintained. The duties powers and prerogatives of the governour are a trust that it is neither his duty to yield up to others, nor the duty of others to infringe. At the same time you will admit, that there are certain distinct powers vested in the judges of the general court, both as legislators and judicial officers, which they cannot part with but in violation of that confidence wºº has been reposed in them by the supreme authority of the United States. With due consideration, I am, Sir, Your most obedient & humble Servant G TURNER Mr SECRETARY SARGENT 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  MARIETTA Septem" 19° 1790. SIR I have the honor to inform you that I arrived at this place on the 15* instant, and brought with me the last of the militia from Pennsylvania—a detachment had moved before I reached Pittsburgh, and have since proceeded to Head quarters, and this morning major Doughty with this last party and the garrison of Fort Harmar, moves down likewise, and as the passage will not take more than four or five days the whole will probably assemble at Fort Washington at nearly the appointed time, as I am informed that those who are to come from Kentuckey will be punctual—It is with pain however I am obliged to mention, a deficiency in the Quota of Pennsylvania of upwards of two hundred men. It is possible that, from the farther power the President has been pleased to invest me with, that deficiency may be supplied in time, but that can form no excuse for Executive of that State who never took the least step in consequence of the information they received from the President, that eventually a call might be made upon the State by me, and for want of which step the whole business might have fallen thro’—for the lieutenants of the counties hesitated about complying with the demand without their directions, and altho' they were applied to by them on the subject, and I know their application got to hand in time, for some of them I delivered myself, they did not give themselves the trouble to reply—and so little attention indeed had been given to the Presidents intimation that, in three of the four counties from which the draughts were to be made there was not, nor had not been for a long time a single officer in commission but the lieutenants. The depredations on the Ohio and the Wabash still continue—every day almost brings an account of some murder or robbery, and yesterday a number of horses were taken from this settlement—not long ago a boat belonging to Mº Vigo a gentleman of Post Vincennes was fired upon near the mouth of blue river *—This person the United States has been very much obliged to on many occasions, and is in the truth the most disinterested person I have almost ever seen—he had three men killed and was obliged in consequence to fall down the river— This party it seems had been designed to intercept me, for they reported that they had had three fair discharges at the governors boat, and expected they had killed him—in descending the river Mº Vigo's boat fell in with Mº Melchor returning from the Tennessee, and attempted in company with him to ascend the Wabash—here they were attacked again—Melchor escaped and fell down it seems to Ance de la Graise, but the savages possessed themselves of Vigo's boat which they plundered of all his and the crews personal baggage and arms, but as she was navigated by frenchmen they suffered them to depart with the peltries, telling them that if they had not been in company with americans they would not have injured them, and that, if they found them in such again they would put them to death—Cap" M*Curdy likewise was fired upon between Fort Washington and this place, and had five or six men killed and wounded.

Major Sargent discharged at Post Sº Vincennes the accounts of the two Gamelins who were sent by major Hamtramck with the message to the Wabash indians amounting to two hundred & five dollars— and took their bills upon me which I had desired them to draw, after the accounts should be certified by major Hamtramck—had I met the major at Fort Washington I could have reimbursed him on the spot, but I cannot do it here nor with any convenience at Newyork—will you be pleased to advance it to him and charge it to my account as superintendant, for I know a disapointment would be very inconvenient to him and you will much oblige me.” I have since got a very genteel intelligent young [MS. torn] a son of Colonel Meigs,” to go with the letter to Detroit.

SIR, I have received your letter of the 25*ultimo withits enclosures.” I am apprehensive that Governor Sº Clair's communication of the object of the expedition to the Officer commanding at Detroit has been unseasonable and may have unfavorable consequences—it was certainly premature to announce the operation intended until the troops were ready to move—since the Indians, through that channel, might receive such information as would frustrate the expedition.” I am Sir, Your most obedient Servant  To The Secretary of War November 4, 1790 GOVERNOR ST.

Gen' Harmer.”— I expected little from the moment I heard he was a drunkard.”— I expected less as soon as I heard that on this account no confidence was reposed in him by the people of the Western Country.-and I gave up all hope of success, as soon as I heard that there were disputes with him about command.— The latter information is from report only; but the report of bad news is rarely without foundation.—If the issue of this Expedition is honorable to the Concerters of it, & favorable to our Arms, it will be double pleasing to me; but my mind, from the silence which reigns, and other circumstances, is prepared for the worst;-that is—for expence without honor or profit.— If anything more than the statement of this business for the information of Congress should occur to you, previous to my arrival, be so good as to digest it, for it is my wish to have every matter which may occur to the heads of Departments as well as to myself, ready, if proper to lay before that body, at the opening of the Session.”—With sincere friendship, & affect” regard I am–ever Y" G” WASHINGTON PS.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE INHABITANTS OF GALLIPOLIS 44  No 25.45 [November 21, 1790) GENTLEMEN, It was with great pleasure, that I heard of the arrival of a number of french men in this country—bound to each other as the french and americans are by the dearest of all ties, I hoped that here they would have found that independance and happiness, which is the reasonable wish of all mankind; and although it may have been delayed, it is my fervent wish as it is a well grounded hope, that it has been only delayed. I feel gentlemen very sensibly for your situation and nothing on my part shall be wanting to render it as agreeable as circumstances will admit of; but in the establishment of new settlements there are difficulties to be encountred; patience and perseverance will get the better of them, and when they are got over, they become real pleasures on reflection; I know the generous sentiments of french men too well, to fear that difficulties arising from the nature of the case, can discourage them. I am altogether unacquainted with the nature of the contract that has been made with the Scioto company, or what may be the specific pretentions of individuals—The laws of the country will however compel justice to be done, and those laws will be extended to you as early as it is possible—They can know the Scioto Company as an individual only, and their course must be general, you will therefore readily perceive the impossability of a person being appointed to judge expressly between the Colonists and that company. Courts will be established where justice will be duly, and regularly administered according to the laws, and where neither favour nor influence will have any weight; and it will be among the first matters I shall attend to, after my arrival at Marietta, to make those arrangments for your security and peace; but as they must all pass through the Secretary's office they cannot be taken earlier. After having borne with the difficulties of your situation hitherto, I intreat you to bear with them yet but a very little longer, for I am as strongly impressed with the necessity of an established police, as well as a militia as you yourselves can be, and be assured that it is my warmest wish that you may find in this land of liberty that happiness which is the reward and the incentive to an active life, to procure which for you, Gentlemen, you may depend upon my best endeavours.” I thank you Gentlemen very sincerely, for your good wishes, and am, Gentlemen, A*S* CLAIR. GALLIPOLIS Nov' 21st 1790. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO SECRETARY SARGENT  MARIETTA, November 27th, 1790. DEAR SIR:—I have the pleasure to inform you that I got back to this place the day before yesterday in good health, notwithstanding an attack of the gout which laid hold of me on the River the second day after leaving Fort Washington. My position was a bad one, but the Brimstone proved once more too strong for it with all that advantage. It was with pain I heard of your being ill on the road; I hope you got down safe and that your health is reestablished. On considering all circumstances, I believe that Cincinnati will be found the most proper place for the seat of the government. If, therefore, you should have an opportunity to secure any of the lands you mentioned, I would be glad to be concerned in a small part. Without something like a farm, it will not be possible to exist in this country, but neither my inclination nor my resources permit me to engage largely, and besides it appears from the increasing population of this country that the Governor will have little time to spare to the cultivation of the earth. He must, I believe, be for a long time to come almost always passing from place to place, unless a division of the Territory should take effect. You may probably have been able to learn something about that matter. If it is likely to happen, this place would not be an improper site for one of the divisions. Should however, the posts be delivered agreeably to the Treaty, I have no doubt but the seat of government must be transferred to Detroit which in any provisional measures you may think of it will be proper to keep in view. I have it in contemplation to visit Philadelphia this Winter, and to that end to leave this place as soon as I can get the civil arrangements for the French settlement thro' which will not probably require more than a week.” This, however, need not make any alteration in your plans, for should you be able to return by Christmas, which I think was what you proposed, the little interregnum that will happen  between my departure and your arrival will be of no manner of consequence. Indeed, it is necessary—as well on account of some public business as my private affairs, that I should be in Philadelphia about the time that Congress will meet. General Harmar has made a very succesful compaign, tho' you will regret with me the loss of our friend, Major Wyllis, who was sacrificed by the militia. They left him with his handful of continental troops to sustain the attack of a large body of Indians. Every man of them fell but three. They sold their lives, however, dear. Indeed, there never has been any affair with the Indians in which they lost so many men as in this campaign. We have as yet no certain information from Major Hamtramck. Had he been unfortunate we would have heard it long ago. The reports from Kentucky are that the Indians fled before him every where—that four of their towns and a vast quantity of provisions had been destroyed, and that that part of the militia had got home without the loss of a man. A little time will give us the truth, but it is not improbable you have it already thro' the wilderness, for I have been seventeen days upon the River. Adieu-Believe me ever, dear Sir, Your very humble servant, A. St. CLAIR To WINTHROP SARGENT, Esq. 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT  [December 10, 1790 °] Governor Sº Clairs proposal of obtaining a cession of territory from the Wabash Indians at this peculiar time,” seems liable to several objections" 1* It is not for the interest of the United States to extend their territory at present. They possess abundantly more Land, than they can profitably sell. But was there a market for more Land the policy of scattering our people in distant thin settlements may be justly disputed. It will be our true wisdom to condense our population instead of dispersing it. Besides the expence of protecting such distant settlements greatly exceeds the value of them, whether considered as purchasers of the Land, as consumers of articles contributing to the revenue, or as constituting a strength of any real use to the empire. 2" To grasp at additional territory will give the expedition an avaricious aspect. In this point of view it will disgrace the government.” - The motives of the expedition ought to appear as they really are— A clear and uncompounded dictate of Justice to punish a banditti of robbers, and murderers, who have refused to listen to the voice of peace and humanity. and as a terror to warn other tribes against the commission of similar crimes. It will not materially lessen the charge to assert the United States propose to pay the Indians for the lands—because it is a well known fact, that unless they could be civilized, and learn the arts of agriculture, the taking away their lands for the usual pitiful considerations, is taking away the means of supporting their lives. But it would be a difficult circumstance to convince the people of the United States, of the propriety of paying any considerable sums to the obnoxious tribes, whose enormities have caused the expence of so much treasure, and blood. To obtain Lands of the Wabash Indians at this time, either by conquest or by purchase would afford such of the people of Georgia, as are dissatisfied with the creek treaty, and the Yazous and Tennessee companies, with cause for impeaching the rectitude of the General Government, for extending its own territory and circumscribing the States. If deputies from the hostile tribes should be sent to Fort Washington as the Governor supposes, they must be fed while they remain at that post. and upon their departure they might receive some blankets. But nothing more at present. They ought to be made to feel the inconveniencies of their conduct— It would have an absurd appearance, to raise an army at great expence to destroy the Indians corn, and upon the objects being effected, to replace the corn which had been so destroyed—  Report of the Secº of War upon a proposition to purchase land from the Wabash Indians

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT  [December 14, 1790) The Secretary of state having had under his consideration the journal of the proceedings of the Executive in the North-Western territory, thinks it his duty to extract therefrom, for the notice of the President of the U.S. the articles of Apr. 25. June 6. 28. & 29. some of which are hereto annexed.” Concieving that the regulations, purported in these articles, are beyond the competence of the Executive of the said government, that they amount in fact to laws, & as such could only flow from it's regular legislature. that it is the duty of the General government to guard it's subordinate members from the encroachments of each other, even where they are made through error or inadvertence, and to cover it's citizens from the exercise of powers not authorized by the laws, the Secretary of state is of opinion that the said articles be laid before the Attorney General for consideration, and, if he finds them to be against law, that his opinion be communicated to the Governor of the North-Western territory for his future conduct.” Dec. 14. 1790 TH: JEFFERSON 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT [Dec. 14. 1790) The Secretary of state having had under his consideration the Report, made by the Secretary of the government North West of the Ohio, of his proceedings for carrying into effect the resolution of Congress of Aug. 29. 1788.* respecting the lands of the inhabitants of Post Vincennes,” makes the following Report thereon to the President of the United States. The Resolution of Congress of Aug. 29. 1788. had confirmed in their possessions & titles the French & Canadian inhabitants & other settlers at that post, who, in or before the year 1783. had settled there, & had professed themselves citizens of the U. S. or any of them, and had made a donation to every head of a family, of the same description, of 400. acres of land, part of a square to be laid off adjoining the improvements at the post. The Secretary of the North Western government, in the absence of the Governour, has carried this resolution into effect, as to all the claims to which he thought it could be clearly applied. there remain however the following descriptions of cases on which he asks further instructions. 1. Certain cases within the letter of the resolution, but rendered doubtful by the condition annexed to the grants of lands in the Illinois country. the cases of these claimants, fifteen in number, are specially stated in the paper hereto annexed Nº. 2. & the lands are laid off for them, but remain ungranted till further order.” 2. Certain persons who, by removals from one part of the territory to another, are out of the letter of the Resolution, but within it’s equity, as they concieve. 3. Certain heads of families, who became such soon after the year 1783. who petition for a participation of the donation, & urge extraordinary militia service to which they are exposed. 4. 150. acres of land within the village, granted, under the former government of that country, to the Piankeshaw Indians, & on their removal sold by them in parcels to individual inhabitants, who in some instances have highly improved them both before & since 1783. 5. lands granted both before & after 1783. by authority from the Commandant of the post, who, according to the usage under the French & British governments, thinking himself authorised to grant lands, delegated that authority to a court of civil & criminal jurisdiction,” whose grants before 1783. amount to 26.000 acres, & between that & 1787 (when the practice was stopped) to 22,000 acres. they are generally in parcels from 400. acres down to the size of house lots; & some of them under considerable improvement. Some of the tenants urge that they were induced by the court itself to come & settle these lands, under assurance of their authority to grant them, & that a loss of the lands & improvements will involve them in ruin.—besides these small grants, there are some much larger, sometimes of many leagues square, which a sense of their impropriety has prevented the grantees from bringing forward.—many pretended grants too of this class are believed to be forgeries, & are therefore to be guarded against. 6. 2400 acres of good land, & 3000 acres of sunken dº held under the French, British, & American governments, as Commons for the use of the inhabitants of the village generally, & for 30. years past kept under inclosure for these purposes. The legislature alone being competent to authorize the grant of lands in cases as yet unprovided for by the laws, the Secretary of state is of opinion that the Report of the Secretary of the North Western government, with the papers therein referred to, should be laid before Congress for their determination. authentic copies of them are herewith inclosed to the President of the United States."

CLAIR TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (OSL: St. Clair Papers: C *] PHILADELPHIA, (no date"), 1790 SIR: I have the honor to envelope the Papers you were pleased to desire Yesterday—In a former Conversation you had suggested a doubt whether the Laws of the western Territory that had been made (in contradistinction to being adopted) by the Legislature would be binding upon the People—the same doubt had arisen in my mind early, but I gave way to the Opinion of the Judges, and to the necessity of the case—they were decidely of the Opinion that, from a clause in the Ordinance which declared the Laws “adopted or made” by the Governor or Judges to be binding during the existence of the temporary Government, if not disapproved by Congress, gave them full power to legislate in that manner; and it is certain that, from the peculiar Circumstances of the Country, in many Cases, no Laws of the original States would be found to apply to their Occasions exactly without alterations, and, if they were altered to those Occasions, they would cease, it would seem, to be the same Laws."—They have doubts likewise whether the Laws of the united States can have course in the Territory unless it be especially named in them, and it has been proposed to me that such as may be necessary should be adopted; but, from the words of the Ordinance which gave the Power to adopt Laws, it is doubtful whether the Laws of the united States can be comprehended. I do not recollect any Case that has yet happened where any inconvenience has followed—but I do not know how Treason, for example, against the united States, could be punished, and yet it may be committed in a Territory. No provision has been made for an Attorney General—the power to appoint one is clear enough,” but the infant situation of the Country forbids the People being burdened with Salary, at the same time it seems to be a very necessary Office, were it only as Law Counselor to the Governor.— I am sure I have felt the want of such Counsel very much, and the Persons who may succeed me in the Office may be in like Circumstances; and it is not expected that any Person of sufficient Abilities will accept the appointment without a Salary, especially when it is considered that they have a Circuit to attend to of more than a thousand Miles in every year. I shall be very much obliged to you Sir for your Advice about the Possessions of the ancient Settlers on the Mississippi, and that if you think it necessary, you would bring the doubtful points I have mentioned before the President of the united States, and permit me to observe, Sir, that when the very great Distance that Country is and ever will be from the Seat of the Government, there seems to be a necessity for the Titles of Confirmation being made within the Territory or at least a Provision that they may be put on record there. I have the honor &" THE HON” THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE PRESIDENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR [Huntington Library: ALS 6°) (Private) PHILADELPHIA Jamy 2° 1791. DEAR SIR, In the Journals of the Proceedings of the Executive in the North Western Territory, there appears to be certain regulations made by the Executive under the Articles of the 25" of April–6* 28” & 29* of June last,” which can, with propriety, only be established by Laws.”— In noticing these, my mind naturally recurred to your letter to me dated at Cahokea on the first of May last,” wherein you observe, that the absence of the Judges had embarrassed you a great deal; and after waiting for them as long as possible, that you had been under the necessity of directing by proclamation certain regulations suited to the peculiar circumstances of the Country.—These you had no doubt would be soon confirmed by law—and the necessity of the case offered an excuse for having exceeded your proper Powers.- The imperfect State in which the Legislation of the North Western Territory is—the want which the Executive has often felt of the necessary coadjutors to adopt even the most urgent Laws—and the peculiar situation of a frontier Country, are circumstances which may not strike every one who will observe that the Executive has gone beyond [his] proper powers. It therefore becomes a matter] of high importance that the utmost circumspection should be observed in the conduct of the Executive; for there are not wanting persons who would rejoice to find the slightest ground of clamor against public Characters—and paying no regard to the absolute necessity of the case which caused a momentary stretch of power—nor the public good which might be produced by it, they would seize the occasion of making impressions unfavorable to Government & possibly productive of disagreeable effects.- I have therefore thought it best to give you this intimation in a private and friendly letter, that by circumspection maſlice] itself may be disarmed.

By the Instructions of Congress of the 29" of August " I had conceived myself authorised to send such Patents of confirmation and that it was expected from me, but the Attorney is of Opinion that the Instructions does not give the Power to that End, and consequently a Law for the purpose is necessary *—I would beg the favor Sir that you will bring the Subject before Congress, for it is of importance that those People be quieted in their Possessions as soon as possible.” With great Respect &" Febry 20 1791 THO" JEFFERSON Esq. Secretary of State 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,  [February 10, 1791] SIR I beg leave to present the enclosed Report of my proceedings in the Illinois Country in the Course of the last year, and to suggest that you lay it before Congress. A part, if not the whole of them has, no doubt been transmitted by the Secretary from time to time; but, as I was directed by the Resolution of Congress of the 28* of August 1788° to report specially these are now collected into one View. I am sensible Sir that it may have been expected to have been sooner, but the Situation I have been in ever since last June last, during which time I have been obliged to travel near upon five thousand Miles, either in an open Boat or upon Horseback, and often separated from my Papers rendered it impossible. The inquiring into the Claims and Titles of the people of that Country which are all in french and the necessity of translating every public communication into that Language, without any Person to assist me, for no Person that had a competent knowledge of both was to be found, was a very laborious Business will account for some Papers which accompany the Report appearing in that Language, and that I had not always leisure to make the translations into English will be an excuse for that impropriety. 
REPORT OF GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE (SD:N.W. Terr. Papers, I:ADS si] [February 10, 1791] Report of the Governor of the Territory of the united States north west of the Ohio 8” Pursuant to the Resolution of Congress of the 28* of August 1788, and in Obedience to the Instructions of the President of the united States of the 6" of October 1789,” I embarked at Fort Harmar for Kaskaskia on the 20" day of December following and arrived on the 5* day of March 1790. The great length of time consumed in this Voyage was owing to a delay met with at the Falls of Ohio for want of Provisions for the Escort—to being afterwards frozen up in the Mississippi for fifeteen days; and to being again obliged to stop to repair the Damage sustained by the Wessel, which was hurried by the impetuosity of the Stream upon a sunken Tree in the middle of the River, where the Danger of being cast away was very narrowly escaped. Immediatly on my Arrival the County of Sº Clair was erected by Proclamation: *—a Placart was published requiring the Inhabitants to exhibit a State of their Claims to Lands in that Quarter, and a List of the Heads of Families.” It was a considerable time before any Claims were presented, owing partly to the Ignorance of the People, very few of whom are able either to read or write, and partly to their being entirely unacquainted with the English Language:—they were at length brought forward, and such of them as were found to come within the Resolution of Congress are contained in the Paper marked N° 1.* N° 2 * is a List of the Inhabitants, and Nº. 3 a copy of the Placart.87 No Plan of the Town of Kaskaskia could be found either in the public Offices or in the Hands of Individuals; I was therefore obliged to order one to be taken (of which N° 4 is a Copy “y as it would otherwise have been impossible to describe the Lotts which were to be confirmed. Mr Samuel Baird was appointed to do that Duty, as well as to survey the Lands held by the People, and to run the Lines that had been directed by Congress to embrace the Donations. On an Examination of the Claims, however, it was found that many Grants of Land had been made which would fall to the eastward of the Line to be drawn from the Mouth of the River au Marie; and as all Grants that proceeded either from the Government of France, that of Great Britain, or of the State of Virginia on or before the Year 1783 were to be confirmed, the running of that Line was delayed until Congress should be informed that it would not take in all the Claims, and therefor appeared to be incurring an unnecessary Expense. Orders of Survey were issued for all the Claims that appeared to be founded agreeably to the Resolution of Congress, and Surveys were made of the greater part of them—a Part only of those Surveys, however, have been returned because the People objected to paying the Surveyor; and it is too true that they are ill able to pay. The Illinois Country, as well as that upon the Ouabash, has been involved in great Distress ever since it fell under the american Dominion:-with great cheerfulness the People furnished the Troops under General Clarke, and the Illinois Regiment with every thing they could spare, and often with much more than they could spare with any Convenience to themselves:—most of the Certificates for those Supplies are still in their Hands, unliquidated and unpaid; and, in many Instances where Application for payment has been made to the State of Virginia, under whose authority the Certificates were granted, it has been refused.—The Illinois Regiment being disbanded, a Set of Men, pretending the authority of Virginia, embodied themselves; and a Scene of general Depradation and Plunder ensued:*—to this succeeded three succesive and extraordinary Innundations from the Misssippi, which either swept away their Crops or prevented their being planted:—the loss of the greatest part of their Trade with the Indians, which was a great Resource, came upon them at this juncture, as well as the hostile incursions of some of the Tribes which had ever before been in friendship with them; and to these was added the loss of their whole last Crop of Corn by an untimely frost:—extreme Misery could not fail to be the Consequence of such accumulated Misfortunes. The Paper N° 5 contains the Orders for a Compensation to the Surveyor; * and N° 6 is the Representation of the People praying to be excused from paying it.” A Gentleman, of the Name of Todd, had been appointed by the Governor of Virginia Lieutenant of the County of Illinois,” and some few Grants of Land are said to have been made by him, altho' by his Instructions, which he put upon record at Kaskaskia, he has no Authority to that purpose, but seems rather to have been restrained:— A Copy of those Instructions were transmitted by the Secretary. On M* Todds leaving that part of the Country a Person of the Name of De Numbrun * was substituted, who made Grants of Land without number: The Power of granting Lands was also asumed by the civil Courts that had been established, and that assumed Power they used very liberally, still pretending, however, that they had been authorised so to do by M. Todd, who is stiled Grand Judge for the united States.—It is most probable that such power was never delegated to the Courts by M. Todd; at least it does not appear. All those Grants have been rejected; but I beg leave to suggest, that it might be proper to allow a right of preemption to those who have actually settled and made improvements under them. Some of the Parties seem, respectively, to have had two different Objects in view—the Applicants, the engrossing Lands for a very small Consideration; and the Grantors the accumulation of perquisites: the Courts and sub Lieutenants having exacted four Dollars for each Grant There are a number of american Settlers in possession of such Grants, whose claims have been equally rejected—their Case seems to be a hard one—not doubting the authority of the Courts which they saw every day excercised,” they applied for Lands and obtained them, and made Settlements in consequence, distinct from those of the french; but having removed into that Country after the Year 1783 they do not come within the Resolution of Congress which describes who are to be considered as ancient Settlers, and confirmed in their Possessions;–As Americans they have been the peculiar Objects of Indian Depredation, while their Neighbours the french, from having had much intercourse with the Indians, and frequently intermarrying with them, until very lately were generally safe;— they have in consequence been driven off of the Lands they had improved, and have lost both their time and their labour. Nº 7 is a Representation from them upon this Subject.” Having finished the Business at Kaskaskia, as far as it was possible at that time, on the 5" day of April I embarked, and proceeded up the Missisippi to Cahokia, having stopped at Fort de Chartres, and visited the Village of the Prairie du Rocher which is about a League distant from it, in Land, on the way. Mr Baird had been directed, to make the Surveys there,” as well as at Kaskaskia, and the same Objections to paying for them were raised there as at the latter place. Nº 8 is a power to certain of the Inhabitants to to make Representations to me on the Subject, which was done.” Nº 9 is a Plot of the reserved Tract including Fort Chartres,” It is however to be observed that part of this Tract appears to have been granted when the Country was in possession of the French. From the Mouth of the Kaskaskia River, which is a very beautiful stream that takes its rise a great way in the Country, and is navigable by Boats for a considerable distance, and on the west bank of which the Town is situated, the Missisippi is very rapid as indeed it is from the mouth of the Ohio to that place, with a great many very difficult and dangerous passes:–every where indeed the Current, in the middle of the stream, is too strong to be overcome by Oars; Boats are therefore obliged to keep as close to the shore as possible, and then in many places cannot ascend without towing—the navigation of course might be very easily interrupted, or prevented altogether, were the Spaniards or the Indians disposed to attempt it; and the more so as, in some of the most difficult places, it is necessary to keep the spanish Shore for bound; a Communication however from Fort Massac on the Ohio (or even some distance above it) with Kaskaskia, by Land, may easily be opened:—the distance is from fifty to sixty Miles—the Country is high and the Soil proper enough for a Road, and no considerable Water intervenes but the River au Vase, which is generally fordable at large Riffle which presents itself directly in the Course:-the tedious and dangerous navigation of the Missisippi would be thereby avoided. Above the Misouri River, the Missisippi becomes comparatively a gentle and pellucid Stream, whereas below, it is at all Seasons extremely turbid—above the Illinois River it is truly a gentle stream, its current, as I have been informed no where exceeding three Miles an hour. The Village of Cahokia is situated on a small Creek of the same name, in a fertile plain and about half a League from its Mouth; but, being surrounded with Marshes, it is very unhealthy in the latter part of the Summer and the Autumn, the River however affords a safe and convenient harbour for Boats—it discharges itself nearly opposite to the spanish Village of Sº Louis, and is navigable for two Miles beyond the Town.—half a League lower down the Country and about an equal distance from the Missisippi is the small Village of the Prairie du pont, which is generally considered as part of Cahokia. Here, as at Kaskaskia, no Plan of the Town was to be found, and of course I was obliged to order one to be taken, but a copy of it does not accompany this Report, as by some accident it has been left behind.—The Villages at the Prairies du Rocher and du Pont do not appear to have been ever laid out—The People have built upon the Lands their Lands, which have generally small fronts, in a contiguous, but irregular, manner, which has given to those Places something of the Appearance of Towns.” The same steps were taken to obtain a knowledge of the Lands that were claimed by the People here as at Kaskaskia, and after due Examination Orders of Survey for such as fell within the Resolution of Congress were put into the Hands of Mr Girardin,” the only Person that could be found in all that Country who understood any thing of Surveying—there are a good many Persons in that Quarter also whose Claims have been rejected, who, nevertheless, may be properly considered as having an equitable Right, at least to the preemption. Previous to the issuing any Orders of Survey at Cahokia, it became necessary to decide upon a Claim, set up by the Seminary of Quebec, to a piece of Land four leagues square, granted, many years ago by the Officers then commanding in the Country for the King of France, to the Missionaries of Cahokia and Tamarois: The Bounds of this Concession embraced all the Settlements at Cahokia and the Prairie du Pont, and they had been made, generally, with the consent of the Missionaries for the time being, so long, as the Mission subsisted; when it had dropped settlements (within the Bounds) had been permitted by military Officers both french and English—After a very careful Examination into all the Circumstances it appeared that the Mission of Cahokia & Tamarois had been dropped before the Country was ceded to Great Britain—that it had never been reestablished while it remained under the Dominion of that Power;” and that it did not exist now; the present Curé not being a Missionary,” but a parish Priest supported by the Inhabitants; and, that the pretentions of the Seminary of Quebec were futile and groundless:–it was therefore considered as as Tract of Land that had reverted for want of Heirs, and was by Proclamation, of which N° 10 is a Copy, reunited to the Domain of the united States; and the Inhabitants were put upon the same foot as the other ancient Settlers."—The Survey, mentioned in the Proclamation to have been ordered, was not made because, it afterwards came out that the King of France had disaproved of the Grant and resumed the Soil. Nº 11 is the deposition of Joseph la Bussiere" the Notary who published the Edict of the french King respecting it;" and Nº. 12 a Remonstrance of the Inhabitants respecting a Sale that had been made of a part of it, by an Attorney for the Seminary of Quebec.”—N° 13 the Letter from the Superior of that Seminary mentioned in the Proclamation.” No Returns of Survey from Cahokia are as yet come to hand and it is probable that not many have been made, as the same Objections to paying for them were raised here as elsewhere, and the Inhabitants of that Place are joined in the Remonstrances which have been made by those of the other Villages. It was not possible to establish the Courts of Justice, nor the Militia, in the County of Sº Clair, until Cahokia had been visited, and then it was difficult to establish them conformably to the Law; and no Alteration in the Law could take Place at that time because the Judges, who form a part of the Legislature, were not present.—The Difficulty arose from these circumstances; The Villages and Settlements were at a great distance from each other;-not any of them were sufficiently peopled to admit of being made a distinct County—the whole afforded barely a sufficient number of Persons who were, in any degree, qualified to fill the necessary Offices;–Justice could not have been administered had the Sessions of the Courts been confined to any one Place, even the most central; for, besides the distance, there was considerable danger in passing and repassing;-under these circumstances no Person would have been found who would have taken upon himself the office of a Magistrate; neither could the attendance of Juries have been compelled, and the greatest confusion must have ensued;—The Judges of the Judges" of the County Court of common Pleas were by Law limited to five and not less than three:—The Expedient therefore of dividing the County into three districts was fallen upon, tho not stricly warranted by Law, and the Judges so distributed as to make the holding of that Court practicable; and it was ordained that a Session of that Court, of the General Sessions of the Peace, and of the Probate, should be held in each district, but all as Sessions of the same Courts respectively, and the Prothonotary of the Common Pleas, the Clerk of the Peace and the Judge of Probate were directed to appoint deputies and open Offices in each District: The Proclamation for this Measure has been transmitted by the Secretary of the Territory and is in the Office of the Secretary of State 10–The Measure has since received the Sanction of the Legislature." By the Ordinance for the Government of the Territory the Laws and Customs which had prevailed among the ancient Settlers are to be continued so far as respects the Descent and Conveyance of real property "-the mode of conveyance was an Act before a Notary, and filed in his Office, of which an attested Copy was delivered to the Party—to fulfil that part of the Ordinance it was necessary that Notaries public should be appointed, and one was commissioned at Kaskaskia,” one at the Prairie du Rocher,” and one at Cahokia.”— The Inhabitants of the County were also formed into a Regiment of Militia and Commissions issued for a Lieutenant Colonel and all the subordinate Officers.” The Donations to the ancient Settlers have not been laid out because, at Kaskaskia and the Prairie du Rocher no Person could be found to do it—At Cahokia an Authority was given to M* Girardin for that purpose; " but nothing, I presume, has been done in consequence of it, for the Alteration that was made in the location of these Donations by the Act of the 29" of August,” from the west to the east side of the Hills or ridge of Rocks, throws them at such a distance from their present possessions, (the Hills being of a considerable breadth and not very fit for Cultivation) that, in the existing Circumstances of the Country, they could not possibly occupy them.—they humbly pray that the location pointed out by the Act of the 20" of June 1788.19 may be restored. Nº 14 is a representation respecting their common— What they set forth is true both with respect to their having been long in the occupation of it, and the Quality of what they ask for upon the Hills.20 Great Numbers of People have abandonned the Illinois Country and gone over to the spanish Territory—a claim however is still kept up by them to their ancient possessions; but it is to be remarked that very few Grants were made by the french in fee simple—When any Person quitted their possessions, the Soil seems to have reverted of course to the Domain of the King, and was regranted at the pleasure of the Officers commanding:—It is presumed that, strictly, the Possessions of all those who have so expatriated themselves are fallen to the united States, had they even been granted originally in fee simple, and may be disposed of as they shall see fit, but the loss of the People is severly felt; *—may I be permitted to suggest that a Law declaring those Possessions escheated unless the former owners return and occupy them within a certain time, would not be an improper Measure.” At Kaskaskia the Jesuits held valuable Possessions; The Buildings are gone entirely to ruin, but the Lands are still of some value—On the suppression of the Order in France the Officers of the french King disposed of their property at that place by public Sale,” but before the Sale took Place the Country had been ceded to Great Britain, a circumstance that was not known there—the british Officer who took possession for that Crown considered the Sale as illegal, and laid hold of the Property; * and the purchaser a Mº Beauvais,” and his Descendants, have been kept out ever since A Son of Mº Beauvais now lays claim to it in virtue of the purchase, and throws himself upon the united States to be confirmed in what yet remains of the property for which his Father paid a very large Sum of Money.” The Commerce of the Illinois Country is of some importance in itself, but more so when considered as connected with the Spanish  side of the Missisippi—The Villages on that side of the River having been originally settled by the french, and under the same Government as that part which is now in the possession of the united States, the connection between them is still very intimate, and favors a commercial intercourse, which, tho' illicit, might be carried on by the Citizens of America without risque.—it is carried on at present without risque, but is, unfortunately, almost entirely in the hands of the british—even much the greatest part of the merchandize for the trade of the Misouri River is brought from Michilimackinac by that of the Illinois, partly by the spanish Subjects themselves, and partly by british Traders.-The manner is this —The spanish Subjects either introduce them at once, in consequence of a secret convention with their Commandants, or they are brought down to Cahokia and landed there, and afterwards carried over to Sº Louis as opportunities can be found.— What is brought by the british Traders, the spanish Subjects purchase and pay for on the american side, taking all the risque that attends the introducing them into their own Country upon themselves. The Furs, in which these Goods are generally paid for, Deer skins answering better than Furs at the new Orleans market, are carried to Canada by the same Communication, that is to say up the Illinois River; up the Chicagoo; and from thence by a small portage into the Lake Michigan, and along that Lake to Michilimackinac; or from the Chicagoo up the River au Plein and by a portage into the same Lake. In the spring of the Year the Waters of the Michigan and the Chicagoo rise each to such a heigth that the intermediate Space is entirely overflowed, and is passable by the Vessels in use there, which are bark Canoes, but which carry a very considerable Burthen, and are navigated by three or by five Persons. The Commerce of that Country is of some Importance also as an Object of revenue; for, if the Impost on Importations was extended to it some Money would be produced by it; but the principal advantage would be, that it would contribute to turn the Trade into the Channel of the united States. There is no doubt that the Furs of that Country might be brought up the Ohio River at as little, or even a less, Expense as attends the carriage of them to Cannada "-it has been tried by one Person, a Mr Vigo and found to answer; altho’ the Goods he carried out were transported by Land from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and loaded with an Impost the Competitors were free from, they came to market on better terms than those from Canada—could those also be subjected to it, a decided advantage would be given to the american Trader. - There is another Communication between Canada and the Missisippi by the Ouisconsin River, a little above the mouth of which is the Prairie du Chien:-At that place there was a considerable Town while the Country was in the hands of the French: It has gone to ruin; but by that Communication the british carry on all the Trade of the upper part of the Missisippi, and at the Prairie du Chien they assemble twice in every Year in great Numbers; frequently as I have been informed, to the amount of five or six hundred Persons—it would certainly be for the national honor that an Establishment that would command that Communication was made; but the great Distance, and the Difficulties that might attend the supporting it, will probably prevent it at present. An Establishment at the mouth of the Illinois River would also be very useful, both with respect to the Trade of that River and of the Misouri, but its being regularly innundated once or twice a Year forbids it; there is however an excellent situation some distance lower down, and nearly opposite to the Misouri, at a Place called Payisa,” that would answer:-the Situation is high, the Air pure and healthy, and the Soil good, and across the Country, it is not more than three Miles distant from the Illinois River. It was the Opinion of the best informed Men I conversed with at Cahokia and from Sº Louis, that if a Town were laid out there, and a small military Post erected it would be peopled immediatly, and Sº Louis soon fall again into the same unimportant situation it held before the Misfortunes of the Illinois Country;” At present however Sº Louis is the most flourishing Village of the Spaniards in the upper part of the Missisippi, and it has been greatly advanced by the People who abandonned the American side:- to that they were induced partly by the Oppression they suffered, and partly by the fear of losing their Slaves, which they had been taught to believe would be all set free on the Establishment of the american Government.—much pains had indeed been taken to inculcate that belief, (particularly by a Mº Morgan of new Jersey,) and a general desertion of the Country had like tſo have] been the Consequence.— The construction that was given to that part of the Ordinance which declares there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude was, that it did not go to the Emancipation of the Slaves they were in possession of, and had obtained under the Laws by which they had formerly been governed, but was intended simply to prevent the introduction of others.”—In this Construction I hope the intentions of Congress have not been misunderstood, and the Apprehensions of the People were quieted by it; but the circumstance that Slaves cannot be introduced, will prevent many People from returning who earnestly wish to return, both from a dislike to the spanish Government, and that the Country itself is much less desirable than on the american side—could they be allowed to bring them back with them, all those who retired from that Cause would return to a man. There is a small Settlement up the Illinois River at the old Peoria Town. A Person of the Name of Mayet” had been appointed Commandant of the Militia there by General Clarke, and had continued in that Station until my arrival—As he was found to have considerable Influence with the Savages and had conducted himself with some degree of approbation, it was thought best to continue him, and a Commission of Captain in the Militia was given to him with the Instructions marked N° 15.” Should it ever be thought proper to interdict the Communication with Canada by the Illinois River, there is no Place, at present in the possession of the united States, that would answer the End so well as this at the old Peoria Town:-The River is very narrow, and, the Channel lying close to the shore, every Boat is obliged to pass within small musquet shot. It did not appear proper for me to interupt that Communication at that time; for tho', on the principle of reciprocity, it would be perfectly justifiable in the united States, they should be prepared to fill up the void that would thereby be created—The Savages: the Inhabitants and the Spaniards would at once be cut off from a very necessary Commerce;—it was for that Reason that Mayet was directed to suffer Persons to pass and repass who were furnished with passports—several of the spanish Merchants applied for and obtained them, under the express Condition that they were not to attempt any trade with the Indians. This seemed to be all the hold that could then be well taken of it, and it held out the Idea that the Direction and restriction of the Communication was in the contemplation of Government.—By the Ordinance for regulating Indian Affairs no Person was to be allowed to travel thro’ the Indian Nations without having received the approbation of the Superintendant*—the Passports above alluded to were founded on that Clause of the Ordinance; but, by the Law lately enacted for regulating the Trade and intercourse with the Indians,” it has not been reordained—a Doubt arises whether the Ordinance is not repealed by the Law, and that consequently any Person may travel thro the Indian Nations without asking permission of any One. A contract subsists between Flint and Parker and the late Board of Treasury for a great Tract of Land in the Illinois Country.—no part of the Contract has I believe been complied with on their parts, and probably never will;” but if if it is not attended to, before a Law passes for erecting an Office for the Sale of the Lands, it may create embarrassments hereafter. The Papers N° 16 are the Orders for erecting Prisons and an assignment of Lotts to build them upon”—The Lots at Cahokia had been reserved when the Town was first laid out, for public use, and to that at Kaskkaskia no Person laid Claim. N° 17 is the copy of a Proclamation forbidding Strangers to hunt in the Territory,” and Nº. 18 another to prevent the cutting and carrying away building Timber and fire Wood to the spanish side.” They were occasioned by the Representations of the People that very great Injury was done to Individuals, and to the public, by the spanish Subjects cutting down and carrying away the Timber, while they were not allowed to bring even a Stone (which are plenty on that side and scarce on this) from that Shore; and that great Numbers of them assumed the Liberty of hunting Buffaloe for the Market of new Orleans, to the prejudice of the Citizens, who were not allowed to fire a Gun, upon any account whatever, on the spanish Side. It would have been much more proper that many of those matters, which have been attempted to be regulated by Proclamation, should have been provided for by Law, but the Absence of the Judges prevented it. Having had occasion to make some Representations to the spanish Commandant at Sº Louis and Sº Genevieve, altho they are not of much importance, yet I believe it is proper to submit the Letters that passed between us; they are contained in the bundle marked N° 19.”— No 20 is a Proclamation of the Governor of New Orleans:* Since that, I am informed another has appeared permitting the Importation of every thing the growth of the Countries bordering upon the Missisippi and Ohio Rivers to that City, on the payment of fifteen per Cent ad valorem—I have not been able to obtain a Copy of it. When the two Emissions of Paper Money were called in by Congress, a considerable Sum of those Emissions were lodged in the Office of a Notary public at Kaskaskia, by the Direction of the Lieutenant of the County of Illinois"—there it yet remains, and the owners have received no satisfaction for it of any kind—they complain of this, and it would seem not without reason. There is some Obscurity in that part of the Ordinance which describes the Persons who are to be considered as ancient Settlers, the words are “who on or before the year 1783 professed themselves citizens of the united States or any of them.” A Doubt arises to what part of the Year the word on refers.-does it include the whole Year, or is it confined to the first day of it? Congress may perhaps think proper to give it a determinate application.” Among the Claims for Land that have been rejected, there are several that are founded on purchases made from Individual Indians, and the conveyances set forth that they were inherited from their parents, and were not the property of the Nation—it could not however be discovered that any Division of the Lands of the Kaskaskia Indians had ever taken place, among themselves, and the Chief of that Nation has applied to be confirmed in a Tract of Land of about five or six thousand Acres, where their Village was situated not long ago; and which would take in the parcels that have been sold and applied for as above:–On this Claim no Decision has been made—it appeared to be a Subject that ought to be referred to Congress; but I may be allowed to observe, if one Indian Sale is approved, it is probable that a great many will be brought forward.” At the Falls of Ohio, when on the way to Kaskaskia, information was received that the Inhabitants at Post Sº Vincennes were in danger of perishing for want of Corn, their whole Crop of the last fall having been destroyed by an untimely frost. I immediatly wrote to Major Hamtramack, and requested him, if he found the Case to be as it had been represented, to send, to the Agents of the Contractors for supplying the Troops, for as much as would be absolutely necessary for their preservation. N° 21 is an extract from the Letter to him on the Subject.”—It appeared to be a duty incumbent upon me to preserve the Lives of the Citizens of the Territory, and I flatter myself that the Measure will meet the approbation of the Legislature. The Papers Nº. 22* and 23 are lists of the Heads of Families at Cahokia and the Prairie du Pont and Nº. 24 is the Request of a M’ Gibaut “” for a small Piece of Land that has been in the Occupation of the Priests at Cahokia for a long time, having been assigned to them by the french; but he wishes to possess it in propriety; and it is true that he was very useful to General Clarke upon many Occasions, and has suffered very considerable Losses. I believe no Injury would be done to any One by his request being granted, but it was not for me to give away the Lands of the united States. Before I close this Report it may be necessary to mention the necessity there is for a printing press in the western Territory—The Laws adopted or made by the Legislature are declared to be binding upon the People until they are disaproved by Congress—There is no way of giving them any publicity but by having them read at the Courts, and but few People become thereby acquainted with them—even the Magistrates who are to carry them into Execution are strangers to them, for the Secretary does not conceive it to be his duty to furnish them with copies; indeed the Business of his Office encreases so fast that it would be impossible to do it.”—besides they are in English, and the greatest part of the Inhabitants do not understand a word of it— the translation of them therefore seems to be necessary, and that a sufficient number of them should be printed in both languages, and that can only be done in the Territory where the original Rolls are deposited.—Every public Act & communication of what kind soever I was myself obliged to translate into french, and having no Person to assist me, it made the Business extremly troublesome and laborious. The Situation of Indian Affairs rendering it necessary that I should return to the Seat of Government I did by Letter resign the Government of the Territory into the hands of Mr Sargent on the [11 *] day of [June *] and embarked for the head Quarters of General Harmar to consult with him, on my way, upon the Measures that would be necessary and practicable for the defence of the Country. Some Apology seems to be necessary for some of the Paper[s] that accompany the Report appearing in the french Language—The Originals of all of them, which required publication, were published in English as well as in french—all the Communications with the Indians which were numerous had to be translaſted] into that Language on account of the Interpreters—as well as their Answers into English— from June until my arrival in the City I have been in constant motion either on horseback or in an open Boat where the copying of Papers was impossible, had I not been separated from them; and they did not come to hand here till very lately—in that time I was been obliged to travel above four thousand Miles, the necessity that this Report should be made before the present Session of Congress ended, seemed to forbid any further delay and will I hope excuse that impropriety. A* Sº CLAIR Governor of the Territory of the united States north west of the Ohio. Postscript In the course of the last Fall a considerable number of french Emigrants have been introduced into the Territory, and on my last return from Fort Washington I found about four hundred of them at a place they have named Gallipolis, three Miles below the mouth of the great Kenhawa on the opposite side of the River. They were living in Barracks that had been provided for them by the Scioto Company, but did not seem to be at all usefully employed, and were much discontented—It was not half an hour after my Landing that the Paper marked N° 25" was put into my Hands by a Number of Persons deputed for the purpose N° 26 is my Answer." The Regulations there promised have not yet taken place from the want of proper information with respect to the Characters best fitted to fill the civil and military Offices. I had desired a list from some of the principal Persons themselves and one also from an Agent of the Scioto Company who resides with them, to have an Opportunity of comparing them, not chosing to rely altogether upon the recommendations of either, but they were not sent forward, and the Communication was cut off by the Ice. About one hundred more of those Emigrants are at the Muskingham, and one hundred at Buffaloe Creek in Pennsylvania, waiting the opening of the Season to establish themselves near the Scioto.

JUDGE PUTNAM TO THE PRESIDENT, MARIETTA February 28th 1791 SIR Sence the affair of the 2" of January.” Several Wyandot men & women have ben in to Fort Harmer to Trade, they approched with Shyness and in truth our people ware at a loss how to treat them, but on the whole it was thought best, and they ware recived & treated in the Same frindly maner as heretofore: althoe Sculking parties ware at the Same time discovered houvering round Some of our Settlements; * the accounts these indians give of the affair at the Big-Bottom, are various—the first reported thet they Saw their Trail on their return & that by marſks] they left on certain trees they ware 76 in number & had 20 Scalps—the next account was from one Gevoto a Wyandot man who Said he was told by a man who Saw them, that they consisted of about 30 and that they had Some prisoners as well as Scalps—that they came from a Village on the Tawa river—and another account we have from a Wyandot who Said he Saw the party on their return neer Sandusky, that they ware chiefly Mingos consisted of abut 30 and had 5 prisoners:–the Indians who have ben in, all agree that a great many Indians are going to war, but pretend that the Wyndots & Dellawares are not, and that we must expect a great many here in a few weeks—about ten days ago a Soldier was taken within 60 rods of Fort Harmer but he had the good fortune to make his escape the first night, and the next day came in to the Settlement at Belle-prie, the Soldier] Sais thet he was first taken by three and carred a few miles when they came to 4 others, that one of them Spake good English and was very perticuler in his enquierris respecting the number of men at Fort Harmer, Marietta, & Belle-prie the night after the Soldier got into Belle-prie, a party of Indians (Supposed to be the Same who took the Soldier) brook open a number of Deserted houses in the lower part of Belle-prie Settlement, but they did no damage to any of the property except killing one Sheep and two fat hogs a part of which they took of-Our people have nearely compleatd their works of Defence, and I have no great apprehentions for the imediate Saifty of their persons but their forage, Corn & Cattle Still remain exposed as they have not ben able hatherto to remove them to places of Security— the present crisis appears to me important, not only as it respects the inhabitants of these frontiers but the united States in General—for Should Goverment take efectual measuſres] to bring the natives to Submission, & for the protection of those who have Settled under her authorety, She may fairly calculate on a rapid sale of her lands, by which She may Sink many millions of her National Debt—but on the Contrary Should She leve her Citizens to be insulted & murdered by the Savages, I think it dos not require the Spirit of prophecy to foretell the consequence. No more lands will be purchased but will probably be Seized on by privit adventurers who will pay little or no reguard to the laws of the United States or the rights of the natives—It is a fact Sir, well known that imediately after the conclusion of the war in 1783 privet adventurers, in a perticuler way, located & by building Cabbens, girdling trees or planting a few hills of Corn, took posetion of all the most valuable land on the Muskingum, Hockhocking, and other rivers as well as on the ohio for Several hundred mils, Nor must it be forgot that numbers of these people ware driven off by the federal Troops at the point of the Bayonet, their houses burnt & corn destroyed—when therefore it Shall be known that Congress have given up the protection of the Country, what are we to expect but these people, with others of like priniples, will return like a flood & Seize the country to them Selves, and Should this be the case is it probable that the United States will ever be able to reduce them to obediance without incuring a much greater expence then the chastizeing the Indians in a proper maner & the necessary establish[ment] for the protection of the Settlements can posiably amount [to].” all the Settlements in Virginia bordoring on the Ohio in our Neighbourhood are erecting defences—We here that 7 persons ware killed about two ſweeks ago neer Short Creek the account of which probably reah you before this—Major Sargent I hear is at Fort Pitt— I have the honour to be with the highest posiable Sentements of Respect Sir your most obedient & most humble Servent RUFUS PUTNAM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [Addressed] His Excellency George Washington Esq’—at Philidelphia to be lodged in the post office at Bedford, or Carslie.

LAND GRANT TO THE INHABITANTS OF VINCENNES AND THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY [March 3, 1791] An Act for granting lands to the inhabitants and settlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country, in the Territory north-west of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their possessions.” Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That four hundred acres of land be given to each of those persons, who in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty three, were heads of families at Vincennes or in the Illinois country, on the Missisippi, and who since that time have removed from one of the said places to the other.” And the Governor of the Territory north-west of the Ohio is hereby directed, to cause the same to be laid out for them, at their own expense, either at Vincennes * or in the Illinois country, as they shall severally elect.

WILLIAM JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  GEORGETOWN, MARYLAND, March 29. 1791. SIR, The enclosed papers,” from the Secretary of the Western Territory, were received by the President of the United States at this place last evening; his engagements with the Commissioners not permitting him to peruse them during his stay here, he commands me to transmit them to you for your consideration, and he requests, if you should think it necessary that they may be reported on. W. JACKSON GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGE SYMMES (OSL:St. Clair Papers: Cii") FoRT WASHINGTON May 23, 1791 SIR By the Instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury of the united States to Mº Ludlow * for laying out the Land, distinguished by the Title of the Miami purchase, I perceive that the eastern Boundary is to begin at a place upon the Bank of the Ohio River exactly twenty Miles distant, following the Meanders of that River, from the Mouth of the great Miami and to run from thence in a course paralell to the general Course of the said great Miami, (as the eastern Boundary). Lands far to the eastward of that Boundary have been settled, and, it is said, sold by You to the present occupants: I beg you, Sir, to explain this matter, for I find myself in a very disagreeable predicament having been led to countenance those Settlements, as being within the Boundaries of the Lands contracted for by you with the Board of Treasury, and in some Measure to give them the Sanction of Government, when it would seem the People by whom they were made ought to have been considered as outsiders upon the Lands of the united States, and removed.” I am told that, even the Ground on which this Fort stands has been sold.” I received Directions, a considerable time ago to lay out the Ground which surround it to be reserved for the Use of the Garrison, but I declined doing it at the time, believing as you had represented that it would be an interference with private property, and supposing the Orders had been founded in mistakes. I now fear the mistake was mine, and that I took for granted, what I should have had evidence of Unless you Sir, can give any satisfactory Reasons why those Orders should not be carried into Execution I shall now obey them.” I have the Honor to be Sir Your very humble Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE HONORABLE JOHN CLEVES SYMMES  Copy to Judge Symmes May 23° 1791 
JUDGE SYMMES TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  - CINCINNATA, May 23° 1791 SIR I have this moment been honored by the receipt of your Excellencys Letter of this day, and have considered the contents.” I am surprised into an Answer thereto if I do it instantly. but I trust Sir, your Justice will not urge a more explicit answer on my part at this moment, than to inform your Excellency, that by having your permission to the papers and documents touching the Miami purchase which are now in my possession at North Bend. I trust with all due submission, that I shall be able to shew to your Excellency that, by my Memorial preferred to the honorable the Congress of the united States in the Year 1787; ” praying their grant to me of all the Lands lying between the great Miami and the little Miami rivers, and extending northerly to a certain boundary line therein set forth; the said Congress was pleased to indulge their petitioner in the premises: and resolved that the commissioners of the board of Treasury, thereon take order. I shall be able to shew to your Excellency, that from the Commissioners of the Board of Treasury, governing themselves from erroneous information of the late Geographer General Thomas Hutchins Esq." they were lead to suppose that I had embraced about two Millions of Acres in the prayer of my Memorial, on which they were ordered by Congress to form a Contract with me on the principles laid down in said Memorial: requiring therefore of me a prompt payment of upwards of one hundred and forty thousand dollars in certificates of debts due by the united States: I agreed to undertake the said payment, and to raise the Money therefor by the sale of the same Land included in the limits specified in the said memorial. That by meeting with much opposition in new Jersey, and many discouraging things suggested to intimidate purchasers, I was not so successful as to sell enough of the land to raise the stipulated first payment for two Millions of Acres, as was represented by the Geographer general to be included within the limits drawn in my memorial; I had however the Success to sell more Land than was sufficient to raise the certificates necessary to discharge the proportion stipulated by the instalments of the contract, to be paid in the first payment, might the supposed Tract of two Millions of Acres be reduced to one Million only. These Sales were made under colour and countenance of the said contract and Scheme of Sale and settlement addressed by me to the Citizens of the united States and published in one thousand Pamplets; a very considerable number of which previous to the sale of one Acre of Land, were submitted to the perusal, approbation or disapprobation of the honorable Members of Congress from every State in the Union, and the Commissioners of the Board of Treasury. That among the first of these Sales, made in good faith with the privity of Congress, and the Board of Treasury, were, as might reasonably be expected (being on the margin of the Ohio) a great part of the Lands lying eastward of the paralel line to which your Excellency has reference. That the proceeds of Sales of these Lands were actually paid forward into the Treasury of the united States previous to my making any proposal to the board of treasury for receding on my part, from the purchase of two Millions of Acres; and to adhere only to so much of the same (still retaining the whole breadth in front) as should cover one Million of Acres only. I also beg leave hereafter to shew, that at the same time that from mistaken information, the Board of Treasury were lead to believe there were two Millions of Acres included in my memorial, there was in fact many thousand Acres deficiency of one Million of Acres, tho’ embracing all the contents from one Miami to the other in front, and extending the rear thereof to the utmost northern limits set forth in my said Memorial. I also trust Sir, that I can shew to your Excellency, that by the Letters which passed between the Commissioners of the treasury Board and myself on this subject, I never did recede from the Banks of the little Miami, and that any measures which they may at that time have taken with me, or that they afterwards took with my Agents to exclude me from the Banks of that River, were not formed on the principles of my memorial with which Congress ordered their compliance. That at the time when I suggested to the Board my inability to discharge the Sum which they required of me as the proportion of two Millions of Acres, to be paid at the first installment, I had actually paid into the treasury, more than a sufficient Sum equivalent to one Million of Acres, which was more than I was under obligations to pay, by as much, as the proportion of the deficiency of one million of Acres, since found to be in the Tract included in the limits of my memorial. That however my Agents may have been drawn in to a compliance with the demands of the commissioners of the Treasury Board in receding from the mouth of the little Miami River and accepting on my behalf of certain boundaries set forth in what is called the second contract, yet that second contract, on the premises being surveyed by the united States will be found invalid on two principles, viz, first, That it extends north easterly such a distance into the Country as to include many thousand Acres beyond what I ever asked for in my memorial to Congress therefore these extraneous Acres cannot be the Land at all for which I pledged myself. For on every principle of Law & Equity it must be constructed, that if A. makes application to B. to grant him the Lands at C. on certain conditions, and B grants to A. the Lands at D. this must be void for departure in the grant from the tenor of the prayer of A. and only B. adhering thereto, can create no obligation on the petitioner A.—secondly, it is void I humbly conceive Sir, on other ground. I can shew to your Excellency, that altho' these Commissioners of the Board of Treasury assumed to sell to me thro' the medium of my Agents at new York a Tract of Country adjoining to, and east of the great miami River, of the breadth of twenty Miles, laying paralell with the general course of that River; yet that it is impossible for the united States to comply on their parts with the Letter or Spirit of the said second contract, for I shall shew to your Excellency from actual Survey, that in most places between the great and the little Miami rivers, to go at right Angles with the general course of the great Miami, a breadth of twenty miles cannot be had at a very short distance from the Ohio; and the Tract of Land between the two miami Rivers, still narrowing as you ascend them; they at length approach within eight miles and a half of each other. The Lands east of the little Miami have never been ceded by the commonwealth of Virginia to the united States, therefore the united States cannot vest in me the fee of the Lands east of the little miami and adjoining thereto as they belong to Virginia or her Citizens. And it must also be void from the deception that would arise to me from the extreme ignorance of both parties touching the Geography of the Country: For it would be absurd in the united States to grant and in me to receive, a strip of Country of so narrow dimensions, extending from the Banks of the Ohio almost to Lake Erie. Whereas by the united States adhering with me to the first contract, published with their privity throughout the united States in one thousand volumes,” under the Sanction of which, the ground on which part of Fort Washington, together with the Towns of Cincinnata and Columbia now stands, and on which more than two thousand good Citizens of the united States are now settled, and their money for the same, long since, received into the Treasury of the Union, were sold, the carrying into execution, and completion of the Miami purchase will be practicable, reasonable and honorable in the united States, and uniform and easy for me; I fear Sir the second will be found utterly the reverse in every point of View. Waving all further reply to your Excellencys Letter at this time, I shall on my arrival at north Bend, enter upon a more full explanation of the premises, reciting authenticated Documents and Surveys which are in my Power, whereby I flatter myself that I shall be able to give full satisfaction in the premises, and shew to your Excellency, that the Occupants now settled to the eastward of the aforesaid proposed paralell line are not intruders, and that they ought not to have been removed therefrom, but were entitled to receive that implicated countenance and sanction with which they have been honored by your Excellency.” I am happy Sir, that there yet remains unsold a considerable Area in front of Fort Washington, together with about one third of the Ground on which the Fort stands; if this tract can be of use to the Garrison, it is as far as I am concerned entirely at the Service of your Excellency and the united States.” I have the honor to be with great defference and respect, Your Excellencys most obedent humble Serv'. signed JoHN CLEVEs SYMMEs“ 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, FORT WASHINGTON May 25* 1791 SIR A few days ago Mº Ludlow presented to me the Instructions * he had received from you for compleating the Surveys of certain Tracts of Land in this Territory contracted for with the late Board of Treasury and requested an Escort of Troops to enable him to comply with those Instructions—The situation of Affairs, and the present weakness of this Garrison put it out of my power to furnish him with the necessary Escort; but, on perusing the Instructions, to my astonishment, I found that the purchase made by Judge Symmes did not extend farther up the Ohio than twenty Miles from the mouth of the great Miami River. He had given out, and published indeed to the World, that he had contracted for all the Lands, to a certain distance northerly, which were contained between the little and the great Miamies as eastern and western Boundaries. On my first arrival in this part of the Territory I found the Judge here, and a number of People settled already, to whom he had sold Lands far to the eastward of the twenty Miles.— It never could have entered into my Head that any Person, much less one invested with a respectable public Character, had published a falsehood—was persisting in it, and availing himself of the pecuniary advantages flowing from it: The Settlement therefore met with all the Countenance which I could give it, which I conceived to be a duty I then owed to the adventurers and to the united States; but I see I was wrong, and find myself in a very disagreeable predicament, having cloathed many Persons with civil and military authority, whom it was more properly my duty to have removed, and so far sanctioned their intrusion on the Lands of the united States. As soon as possible after this discovery I wrote a Letter to Judge Symmes of which the enclosure Nº. 1 is a copy” and Nº. 2 his Answer” which I received this day—. The Answer does not appear in any wise satisfactory, for it is clear that, tho' there had been a proposal for a Contract different from that entered into, it had never been more than a proposal; and he has been selling the Lands of the united States upon the little Miami, which he had not contracted for, to pay for Lands his Agents had contracted for in his name upon the great Miami. As soon as it is practicable M Ludlow shall be enabled to fulfill your Orders—in the mean time I am much at a loss what Course I ought to hold with those Settlers, neither do I know very well where to address myself for Directions—If it is a Business that falls within the Sphere of your Office I shall be happy to receive, and carry into execution any which you may think proper to give—if it does not fall within your Office, may I request the favour of your friendly Advice. It seems to me that all I can do at present, and it may be proper to do it, is to publish a Proclamation warning all Persons against further intrusion, and permitting the occupancy of the present Settlers until the Pleasure of Congress shall be known”—to remove those if it could be done, would be ruin to them, and they are innocent not wilful trespassers; and to revoke the Commissions that have been granted would leave them in a State of Anarchy.

That the consideration, as specified in the aforementioned deeds, was at least as valuable as any that was given on similar occasions— That the negotiation was of the most publick notoriety—That the meaning and intention of the parties were interpreted and explained by persons duly qualified, of whom his Britannick Majesty's interpreter was one; all deposing, that they were present, either at the delivery of the bargained property to the Indians; or at the execution of the deed, as will be found authenticated by Hugh Lord Esquire, captain in the eighteenth british Regiment & then commanding in that Territory. The registry of Kaskaskais will also shew the record of the whole transaction. That further formalities (if, from the British Government, more were necessary to be obtained) were prevented by the almost immediate rupture with Great Britain. That the property of the Lands in question was at the time of purchase in the Natives. That however clear the claim of the Company to the whole of their purchase may be; they hesitate not to express their willingness & desire that a reasonable compromise upon the subject may take place between the United States & them. They therefore pray, that your honorable house may appoint a committee to hear and report upon, the justice of their case, and such proposals as they shall lay before it. This prayer they with confidence, hope will be complied with; both from your known love of justice & the evident advantage that must result to the community, if by a compromise with the company, the necessity of a second purchase from the natives wou’d be precluded. Of this but little doubt can be entertained since the Indians never have denied, and are still ready, as the company are credibly informed, to acknowledge the honesty of the purchase made from them by your memorialists."

STATEMENT OF CAUSES OF THE INDIAN WAR, UNITED STATES, January the 16th, 1792." SIR, AS the circumstances which have engaged the United States in the present Indian War may some of them be out of the public recollection, and others perhaps be unknown, it may appear advisable that you prepare and publish, from authentic documents, a statement of those circumstances, as well as of the measures which have been taken, from time to time, for the re-establishment of peace and friendship. When the Community are called upon for considerable exertions to relieve a part which is suffering under the hand of an enemy, it is desirable to manifest that due pains have been taken by those entrusted with the administration of their affairs to avoid the evil. (Signed) G. WASHINGTON. THE SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR. [January 26, 1792) The CAUSES of the existing HosTILITIES between the UNITED STATES, and certain Tribes of INDIANS North-West of the OHIO, stated and explained from official and authentic Documents, and published in obedience to the orders of the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.” A RECURRENCE to the Journals of the United States in Congress assembled, of the early stages of the late war, will evince the public solicitude to preserve peace with the Indian tribes, and to prevent their engaging in a contest in which they were no wise interested. But although partial treaties or conventions were formed with some of the northern and western tribes, in the years 1775 and 1776;” yet those treaties were too feeble to resist the powerful impulses of a contrary nature, arising from a combination of circumstances at that time; and accordingly all the various Indian nations (the Oneidas, Tuscaroras, and a few individuals of the Delawares excepted) lying on our frontiers, from Georgia to Canada, armed against us. It is yet too recent to have been forgotten, that great numbers of inoffensive men, women and children, fell a sacrifice to the barbarous warfare practised by the Indians, and that many others were dragged into a deplorable captivity. Notwithstanding that these aggressions were entirely unprovoked, yet as soon as the war ceased with Great-Britain, the United States, instead of indulging any resentments against the Indian nations, sought only how to establish a liberal peace with all the tribes throughout their limits. Early measures were accordingly taken for this purpose. A treaty was held, and a peace concluded, in the year 1784, with the hostile part of the northern Indians, or Six Nations, at Fort Stanwix. In January 1785, another treaty was formed with part of the western tribes, at Fort M'Intosh, on the Ohio; to wit, with the Wyandots, Delawares, Ottawas and Chippewas. During the same year, treaties were formed at Hopewell on the Keowee, with all the powerful tribes of the south, excepting the Creeks; to wit, the Cherokees, the Choctaws and Chickasaws." In January 1786, a treaty was formed with the Shawanese, at the confluence of the Great Miami with the Ohio. It was not long before certain turbulent and malignant characters, residing among some of the northern and western tribes, which had formed the treaties of Fort Stanwix and Fort M'Intosh, excited uneasiness and complaints against those treaties. In consequence of representations upon this subject, on the 5th of October 1787, Congress directed, “That a general treaty should be held with the tribes of Indians within the limits of the United States, inhabiting the country northwest of the Ohio and about Lake Erie, as soon after the first of April next as conveniently might be, and at such place and at such particular time as the Governor of the Western Territory should appoint, for the purpose of knowing the causes of uneasiness among the said tribes, and hearing their complaints; of regulating trade, and amicably settling all affairs concerning lands and boundaries between them and the United States.” " On the 2d day of July, 1788, Congress appropriated “the sum of twenty thousand dollars, in addition to fourteen thousand dollars before appropriated, for defraying the expences of the treaties which had been ordered, or which might be ordered to be held in the then present year with the several Indian tribes in the Northern Department, and for extinguishing the Indian claims; the whole of the said twenty thousand dollars, together with six thousand dollars of the said fourteen thousand dollars, to be applied solely to the purpose of extinguishing Indian claims to the lands they had already ceded to the United States, by obtaining regular conveyances for the same, and for extending a purchase beyond the limits theretofore fixed by treaty; but that no part of the said sum should be applied for any purpose other than those above mentioned.” Accordingly new treaties were held at Fort Harmar the latter part of the year 1788, and concluded on the 9th day of January, 1789, with a representation of all the Six or Northern Nations, the Mohawks excepted 7–and with a representation of the following tribes, to wit: the Wyandots, the Delawares, Ottawas, Chippawas, Pattiwatamas, and Sacs.”—By these treaties, nearly the same boundaries were recognized and established by a principle of purchase, as had been stipulated by the former treaties of Fort Stanwix and Fort M'Intosh. Thus careful and attentive was the Government of the United States to settle a boundary with the Indians on the basis of fair treaty, to obviate the dissatisfactions which had been excited, and to establish its claim to the lands relinquished on the principle of equitable purchase. It does not appear that the right of the Northern and Western Indians, who formed the several before mentioned treaties to the lands thereby relinquished to the United States, has been questioned by any other tribes; nor does it appear that the present war has been occasioned by any dispute relatively to the boundaries established by the said treaties. But on the contrary it appears, that the unprovoked aggressions of the Miami and Wabash Indians upon Kentucky and other parts of the frontiers, together with their associates, a banditti, formed of Shawanese and outcast Cherokees, amounting in all to about one thousand two hundred men, are solely the causes of the war. Hence it is proper that their conduct should be more particularly adverted to. In the year 1784, when messages were sent to the Wyandots and Delawares, inviting them to meet the Commissioners, first at Cayahoga, and afterwards at Fort M'Intosh, their neighbours the Miami Indians were also included in the said invitations; but they did not attend.  In the year 1785 these invitations were repeated; but the messengers upon their arrival at the Miami village, had their horses stolen, were otherwise treated with insolence, and prevented fulfilling their mission. In the years 1787 and 1788, new endeavors were used to bring those Indians to treat: they were urged to be present at the treaty appointed to be held at Fort Harmar; but these endeavors proved as fruitless as all the former. “At the council of the tribes, convened in 1788, at the Miami river, the Miami and WABASH Indians were pressed to repair to the treaty with great earnestness by the chiefs of the Wyandots and Delawares: the Wyandot chiefs particularly presented them with a large belt of wampum, holding one end of it themselves, and offering the other to the hostile Indians, which was refused. The Wyandots then laid it on the shoulders of a principal chief, recommending to him to be at peace with the Americans; but without making any answer, he leaned himself and let it fall to the ground: this so displeased the Wyandots, that they immediately left the council house.” " In the mean time the frontier settlements were disquieted by frequent depredations and murders, and the complaints of their inhabitants, (as might be expected) of the pacific forbearance of the government, were loud, repeated, and distressing—their calls for protection incessant—till at length they appeared determined by their own efforts to endeavor to retaliate the injuries they were continually receiving, and which had become intolerable. In this state of things it was indispensible for the Government to make some decisive exertion for the peace and security of the frontier. But notwithstanding the ill success of former experiments, and the invincible spirit of animosity which had appeared in certain tribes, and which was of a nature to justify a persuasion that no impression could be made upon them by pacific expedients, it was still deemed adviseable to make one more essay. Accordingly in April 1790, Anthony Gamelin, an inhabitant of Post Vincennes, and a man of good character, was dispatched to all the tribes and villages of the Wabash river, and to the Indians of the Miami village, with a message purporting, that the United States were desirous of establishing a general peace with all the neighboring tribes of Indians, and of treating them in all respects with perfect humanity and kindness, and at the same time warning them to abstain from further depredations.” The lndians in some of the villages on the lower part of the Wabash, appeared to listen to him, others manifested a different disposition, others confessed their inability to restrain their young warriors, and all referred the messenger to the Indians at the Miami village. At that village some appeared well disposed, but the chiefs of the Shawanese returned the messages and belts, informing the messenger however, that they would, after consultation, within thirty nights, send an answer to Post Vincennes—The promised answer was never received. While the messenger was at the Miami village, two negroes were brought in from our settlements, prisoners; and upon his return to L'Anguille," a chief informed him that a party of seventy warriors, from the more distant Indians, had arrived, and were gone against the settlements. In three days after his departure from the Miami village, a prisoner was there burnt to death. Similar cruelties were exercised at the Ouittanon towns, about the same time; and in the course of the three months immediately after the last mentioned invitation, upwards of one hundred persons were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners upon the Ohio, and in the district of Kentucky. It is to be remarked, that previously to the last invitation, the people of Kentucky who, in consequence of their injuries, were meditating a blow against the hostile Indians (as before intimated) were restrained by the President of the United States, from crossing the Ohio, until the effect of the friendly overture intended to be made should be known.” It is also to be observed, that the Wyandots and Delawares, after having frequently and fruitlessly endeavored to influence the MIAMI and WABASH Indians to peace; upon mature conviction finally declared that force only could effect the object. As an evidence that the conduct of the hostile Indians has been occasioned by other motives than a claim relatively to boundaries— it is to be observed, that their depredations have been principally upon the district of Kentucky, and the counties of Virginia, lying along the south side of the Ohio, a country to which they have no claim. It appears by respectable evidence, that from the year 1783, until the month of October, 1790, the time the United States commenced offensive operations against the said Indians, that on the Ohio, and the frontiers on the south side thereof, they killed, wounded and took prisoners, about one thousand five hundred men, women and children; besides carrying off upwards of two thousand horses, and other property to the amount of fifty thousand dollars. The particulars of the barbarities exercised upon many of their prisoners, of different ages and sexes, although supported by indisputable evidence, are of too shocking a nature to be presented to the public. It is sufficient upon this head to observe, that the tomahawk and scalping-knife have been the mildest instruments of death. That in some cases torture of by fire, and other execrable means have been used. But the outrages which were committed upon the Frontier inhabitants were not the only injuries that were sustained: repeated attacks upon detachments of the troops of the United States were, at different times, made. The following from its peculiar enormity deserves recital.-In April, 1790, Major Doughty was ordered to the friendly Chickasaws on public business. He performed this duty in a boat, having with him Ensign Sedam, and a party of fifteen men. While ascending the Tenessee river, he was met by a party of forty Indians in four canoes, consisting principally of the aforesaid banditti of Shawanese, and outcast Cherokees. They approached under a white flag, the well known emblem of peace. They came on board the Major's boat, received his presents, continued with him nearly one hour, and then departed in the most friendly manner. But, they had scarcely cleared his oars, before they poured in a fire upon his crew, which was returned as soon as circumstances would permit, and a most unequal combat was sustained for several hours, when they abandoned their design, but not until they had killed and wounded eleven out of fifteen of the boat's crew.” This perfidious conduct, in any age, would have demanded exemplary punishment. All overtures of peace failing, and the depredations still continuing, an attempt at coercion became indispensible. Accordingly the expedition under Brigadier General Harmar, in the month of October, 1790, was directed. The event is known.” After this expedition the Governor of the Western Territory, in order that nothing might be omitted, to effect a peace without further conflict, did, on his arrival at Fort Harmar, in December, 1790, send through the Wyandots and Delawares conciliatory messages to the Miamies, but still without effect. The Cornplanter, a war Chief of the Senekas and other Indians of the same tribe, being in Philadelphia in the month of February, 1791, were engaged to undertake to impress the hostile Indians with the consequences of their persisting in hostilities, and also of the justice and moderation of the United States.” In pursuance of this design Col. Procter, on the fourteenth of March, was sent to the Cornplanter to hasten his departure, and to accompany him to the Miami village—and messages were sent to the Indians declaratory of the pacific sentiments of the United States towards them. But both Col. Procter and the Cornplanter, although zealously desirous of executing their mission, encountered difficulties of a particular nature, which were insurmountable, and prevented the execution of their orders.” - Major General St. Clair, in the month of April, sent messages from Fort Harmar to the Delawares, expressive of the pacific designs of the United States, to all the Indian tribes.” A treaty was held at the Painted-Post by Colonel Pickering, in June, 1791, with a part of the Six Nations, at which the humane intentions of the General Government toward them particularly, and the Indian tribes generally, were fully explained.” Captain Hendricks, a respectable Indian residing with the Oneidas, appearing zealously disposed to attempt convincing the hostile Indians of their mistaken conduct, was accordingly sent for that purpose, but was frustrated by unforseen obstacles, in his laudable attempts. The different measures which have been recited must evince, that notwithstanding the highly culpable conduct of the Indians in question, the government of the United States, uninfluenced by resentment, or any false principles which might arise from a consciousness of superiority, adopted every proper expedient to terminate the Indian hostilities, without having recourse to the last extremity; and, after being compelled to resort to it, has still kept steadily in view the re-establishment of peace as its primary and sole object. Were it necessary to add proofs of the pacific and humane disposition of the General Government towards the Indian tribes, the treaties with the Creeks, and with the Cherokees, might be cited as demonstrative of its moderation and liberality.” The present partial Indian war is a remnant of the late general war, continued by a number of separate banditti, who, by the incessant practice of fifteen years, seem to have formed inveterate and incurable habits of enmity against the frontier inhabitants of the United States. To obtain protection against lawless violence, was a main object for which the present government was instituted. It is, indeed, a main object of all government. A frontier citizen possesses as strong claims to protection as any other citizen. The frontiers are the vulnerable parts of every country; and the obligation of the government of the United States, to afford the requisite protection, cannot be less sacred in reference to the inhabitants of their Western, than to those of their Atlantic Frontier. It will appear from a candid review of this subject, that the General Government could no longer abstain from attempting to punish the hostile Indians. The ill success of the attempts for this purpose, is entirely unconnected with the justice or policy of the measure. A perseverance in exertions to make the refractory Indians at last sensible, that they cannot continue their enormous outrages with impunity, appears to be as indispensible, in the existing posture of things, as it will be adviseable, whenever they shall manifest symptoms of a more amicable disposition, to convince them, by decisive proofs, that nothing is so much desired by the United States as to be at liberty to treat them with kindness and beneficence.” H. KNOX, Secretary of War. WAR DEPARTMENT, Jan. 26, 1792. Philadelphia, Printed by D. C. Claypoole. 
SENATOR BENJAMIN HAWKINS 21 TO THE PRESIDENT, SENATE CHAMBER 10 Feby 1792 SIR, Prompted by the free and candid manner you expressed yourself on political affairs to me some days past, I shall without reserve, communicate to you the reasons which induced me yesterday to vote for striking out the second section in the bill which I enclose to you.”— That I may be understood throughout I must take a retrospect on indian affairs for some years back. During the war we acknowledged the Indians as brothers, told them of our difficulties, and embarrassments arising from our contest with Great-Britain, assured them of our disposition tho’ unable, to furnish them such comforts as they had been accustomed to receive, urged them to be patient and declared that when success crowned our efforts, they should be partakers of lived. At the close of the war, being anxiously desirous of paying to our officers and soldiers, as much of their well earned dues, as was apparently within the view of the government, we seem to have forgotten altogether the rights of the Indians. They were treated as tenants at will, we seized on their lands and made a division of the same as possessing allodial right, alloted certain portions to the indians for hunting grounds, and did not even think of offering them compensation for any claims they might pretend to have to those reserved for other purposes of the government. This doctrine it might be expected would be disliked by the independent Tribes. It was so, and was complained of by them. It is the source of their hostility. However, we persevered in this doctrine, till the treaty at Fort Harmar in 1788.” At that period the government pursued different measures, the boundaries were recognised and established by a principle of purchase. Some of the now hostile Indians complained of the conduct of their brethren in ceding their lands, these complaints reached the government, and Governor Sº Clair, was ordered to remedy the defects, in some future treaty. But they would not attend to his invitation and assigned as a reason that he only wanted a relinquishment of their claims to their lands and that they were unwilling to part with them. It was natural to expect that as from our conduct they conceived themselves deprived of what they deemed most precious, that they would be in a state of hostility against us, and the more so, as the British in Canada were ready enough, to misrepresent, all our conduct, to furnish them with military stores, and for some purposes arising from State or commercial jealousy, to encourage them. I read at the last session of Congress the painful detail of Harmars expedition, and the measures proposed by the Secretary at War, to retrieve the honor of our military reputation and to restore peace, I acquiesced in the measures proposed, not because I thought them right, but because I was told that you approved of them, and that they would give efficacy to some pacific plans, you had in contemplation. General Knox told the committee of the Senate, that the President had it in view to bring about a peace by other means than coercive—. General Schuyler and some others declared they would converse freely with you, and could point out how peace could be obtained without the further effusion of blood. Since this, I know of no efforts made by the executive to induce the indians to come to an accomodation previously to the last defeat, except that of Gamelin which was a feeble one, that of Proctors the Cornplanter and one other, which failed from unforseen difficulties. I thought and still think the means of communicating with them are abundant, at Vincents at Kaskaskia and even in Canada, There are French, the favourites of these people, and friendly to us.--While we contemplate the going into their country, we may bid adieu to peace; their attachment to their native soil is such that they will part with it but with their lives. The Miami may be convenient to us, but ruin to them, to part with it, they may be circumscribed for ought I know with the western Indians and Canada, as the six nations are by their neighbours, and have no place of their own to retreat to. I shall make no remark on the defeat of the 4” of november. You are a military Judge. I will only offer as my opinion that the indians did not nor cannot exceed twelve hundred effective warriors.- As soon as the military arrangements were before the Senate I determined to examine more accurately than formerly what was proper for me to do, I applied to the Secretary at War for information on two points, first whether the plan sent in was the result of your opinion, or of that of the war office. and secondly whether if it was committed, and the committee applied for your opinion, it was likely you would give it. I understood his reply to the first to be that it was the result of his reflections submited to you and by you to Congress. And as to the second he thought you would not like to give an opinion. I then determined to exercise my own. I have a great respect for the War officer but he appears to me to be anxiously desirous of having a considerable standing military force, all his views in my estimation tend to that end. He is not alone in that opinion we have some in the Senate, who say that such an establishment is necessary, nay more, indispensable to the preservation of liberty. To a disposition of this sort I attribute the feeble efforts made to purchase a peace. Those at the head of affairs to the westward were for war, all who are dependent on the department are for war, this is their harvest and the indians are to this moment wholly unacquainted with the real disposition of our government. From the best view of our situation to my understanding, I am for compleating the present establishment, adding the cavalry mentioned in the bill, and making adequate provision for such effective militia, as may be called out and enabling the Executive to employ such indians as are friendly to us, and willing to aid us. The present establishment and cavalry, brought all of them for the occasion to a point, aided by suitable militia, and the friendly indians under an officer of activity will accomplish every wish I have on the subject which I confess are not many, I am for peace, I am for the establishment of posts, not in their country but our own; As long as we attempt to go into their country, or to remain there, we shall be at war. Our Finances are unequal to the expensive establishments contemplated by some, we can with the force mentioned gain by Victory, or purchase a peace, We should be to blaim, to run any further risk of being insulted by the British, If they will not give up the posts, They will not quietly suffer an establishment in the neighbourhood of them, We are unable to take them, and it is, thus circumstanced, better for us to be passive for the present. I beg you to be persuaded sir, that altho I write thus freely to you, it is to you only, That I hold it unbecoming in myself, to write or speak, any thing that may lessen, the respect, due to the government and every officer of it.” I have the honor to be, most respectfully sir, your obedient humble Serv" BENJAMIN HAWKINS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  From The Hon” B.

Th.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, PHILADELPHIA March 26th 1792 SIR, I beg leave to offer you my unfeigned Thanks for the honor conferred upon me by the Appointment to the command of the Army of the united States the last campaign. Though that Campaign was unfortunate, I am not conscious that any thing, within my power to have produced a more happy issue, was neglected. As I was prompted, Sir, to accept that Command by no motives of either Ambition or Interest, but by a fervent Wish to be of Service to my Country, and a Belief, perhaps too fondly entertained that I could be so, that I am led to decline it in future proceeds neither from Disgust not Disappointment. Having been much afflicted with Sickness during nearly the whole of the Campaign, tho' I flatter myself the public Interests did not suffer by it, and although my Health is now tolerably restored, my Constitution has received a very severe shock, and I might not again be able to go through the weight of Business which necessarily follows the command of an Army. Although Sir, I am myself persuaded that every thing was done, in the Course of the last Campaign, that could be done on my part, fully to answer the public Expectations, yet it is denied by some, doubted by many, and known to but few out of the Army—A Wish to rectify the public Opinion, and a Duty that, I conceive I owe to myself, induces me to request that an Enquiry into my conduct may be instituted—When that is over I may hope to be permitted to resign the Commission of Major General which I now hold. Should the Result of the Enquiry be that, in any Instance, the Duties of my Station were neglected; or, that I did not improve every Hour, and every Opportunity to the best Advantage; or, that the Operations of the Army, after it was in a Condition to operate; were delayed one Moment in consequence of my illness, I shall patiently submit to the merited Censure.” To whoever may be appointed my Successor, I shall be happy Sir, to give every Light and information my Situation as General of the Army, or of Governor of the western Territory put in my Power to obtain, and to evince to you Sir, and to the World, that the Confidence you were pleased to repose in me was not misplaced.

The body of the letter is in the handwriting of Tobias Lear. * At the end of the draft (SD Archives, Misc. Letters) there appears the following paragraph, with a line drawn around it: “While I accept your resignation, for the cause you state, I sincerely regret the occasion—I fervently hope, that your health may be perfectly re-established, and that you may enjoy uninterrupted happiness.-” The Smith version prints these lines as a part of the letter; but they are not in the letter sent. Captain R. B. Haselden, curator of manuscripts in the Huntington Library, made a careful examination of the original for possible traces of any additional matter. His report, Aug. 30, 1932, follows: “Our letter of Washington to St. Clair, March 28, 1792, is a letter signed, 2 pp. 4to. The upper half of the second page has been removed and the rest of the page contains no writing of any sort. I think this missing portion was lost accidentally as the rest of the same sheet has a very bad crease which has been repaired. I examined the upper half of the complete page with ultra-violet light to see if I could observe any signs of offset from writing that may have been on the missing part, but there was no trace. While I cannot be absolutely certain I do not think that our letter contained any other writing.” It is apparent that this letter and the one from St. Clair to the President of Mar. 26 were drafted in concert by the President, the Secretaries of War and State, and the Governor for public consumption. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT , PHILADA Mar. 28. 1792. SIR I have the honor to inclose you two letters from Judge Symmes of Jan. 25" & 27*.* his letter of Sep. 17.* mentioned in the first of these was received by me Nov. 23. and after being laid before you, was answered Dec. 4.” The part of the answer respecting leave from you to come to Philadelphia, was in these words. ‘the President does not conceive that the Constitution has given him any controul over the proceedings of the Judges, and therefore considers that his permission or refusal of absence from your district would be merely nugetory'. With respect to the escort for the judges on their circuits, you will be pleased to determine whether the good of the service will permit them to have one from the military, or whether that part of the letter shall be laid before the legislature to make regular provision for an escort. That part of the letter respecting jails, must, as I apprehend, be laid before the legislature. The complaint against Cap' Armstrong, in the letter of Jan. 27. coming formally from a judge, will require notice.” a civil prosecution in the courts of the Territory appears to me most proper. perhaps a formal instruction to the Governor as Commander in chief to put his officers on their guard against any resistance to civil process might have the effect of preventing future disputes. I shall have the honor of waiting on you to take your pleasure on these several subjects, & have now that of being with sentiments of profound respect & sincere attachment Sir Your most obed' & most humble serv" TH: JEFFERSON THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. S.  From the Secy of State 28th March 1792. 
MAJOR. J. F. HAMTRAMCK TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  FORT KNOX March 31. 1792 SIR The 28* Instant I received a letter from Lº Col. Wilkinson who informed me of his appointment in the army and who directed me to send some agents to all the Belligerent Tribes of Savages, resident on the Wabash Illinois river, and on the South eastern borders of Lake Michigan, which shall be done as speedily as possible. Since my last letter I had the honor of writing you, the Chiefs of the Eel River and of the Weya have been with me, their intention is to be at peace with the United States, and to have for its basis, certain articles of agreement,” which I have made with them and the only ones I could find to be consonant to their wishes. This negociation having taken place previous to my receiving the orders of Lieut Col. Wilkinson, will I suppose be found sufficient without sending to them—however if it should be found necessary for them to go to Fort Washington, they soon can be informed of it—From Col. Wilkinson I expect to receive farther directions on that point. The Peankishaws the only nation remaining on the Wabash, who have not yet been with me have been prevented by the death of their King, on his way to Fort Knox and the Nation having no Prince Royal to succeed to the Crown have been employed for a long time in the election of a Monarch whenever that is done, which will be in about a week, I expect to see them when I will probably have an opportunity of securing their friendship—Indeed I have very little doubt of their adopting the measures of the others —Altho the Indians did not show a disposition to return to war, I found it was necessary to guard against their joining those of the Miami who will no doubt give them very pressing invitations in the spring—this could not be done without some engagements on both sides which I have the honor to inclose. I hope Sir they will be acceptable, I have done for the best, and all that could be done. It is difficult for me to give you any assurance of their sincerity—if they are sincere, it is from no other motive but to get back their prisoners—however—it may be very easy after this to keep them in a pacific State, and to prevent them from joining those who are hostile, this can be effected by some acts of generosity towards them—for if our Government does not make them presents they will go to the British, who will be glad to see them and who will supply them amply—I asked the two chiefs of Eel River who were with me, and who are neighbours to the Miamis if the British had given any presents to the Indians last summer—their Answer was— Yes my father, the Goods were in large heaps like stacks of Hay"—do you get Arms and Ammunition also? We get every thing but big Guns. If you had done so and if your people had not told the Indians that their lands belonged to you you would have had no war—I have been informed by some Indians that a number of Merchants with Goods from Michlemackinac were in the prairies towards the Illinois River trading with the Indians.” Indeed I am sure some of them have been on the Wabash and undersold our Merchants and there is now in this village a quantity of goods from that place and New Orleans which consequently has paid no duty to the United States— The Laws of this Territory or the laws of the United States have made no provision to prevent it, to the great detriment of those merchants who buy their goods in the United States and cannot sell so cheap. But the worst evil of all is a number of Villains in this Village who keep the Indians continually drunk. there is so much difficulty and ceremony to find them out that not one of them has yet been punished since the civil government has taken place, and the most fatal consequences may be expected if it continues—for the Indians, who will sell all their peltrys for liquor will find themselves and families naked in the spring and having no means to procure ammunition or other necessaries will go to war for plunder—the only possible way to prevent this abuse would be to prohibit all spiritous liquors to be brought into the place—without permission from the commanding Officer, and if only one or two Men were intrusted to sell or keep liquor in his house, it would be a very easy thing to prevent the Indians from getting drunk—Such measures may possibly be contrary to the principles of a republican Government, but it is not less necessary in this place in our present situation of affairs—Civil Law is an admirable institution any where except on a frontier situated in the center of an Indian Country and in a time of War—before the civil authority took place, I was well acquainted with every thing that passed in the village. No Indians came in. No person gave them lodging without my knowledge, few of them got drunk in comparison to what it is now All persons and strangers coming into the village were obliged to report themselves, by which means I received every intelligence The Governor sensible of the necessity of such regulations, has by proclamation and militia orders provided for its continuance, but I am sorry to say that no part of it is put in execution neither is it in my power at present to enforce it—  All the information I could obtain from the chiefs who were with me, was that all the Indians of the Lakes intended to go to war early in the spring and that their Women and Children were to be supplied with provisions by Cap" M*Kee the British Agent for Indian affairs— they also informed me that the pieces of Cannon lost on the 4” of November last, were left on the ground, that a large party of Indians intended to keep at a small distance from the place to attack any body who should come to take them off that the number of the Indians against us last action had been about 1500—that we were then about four good days march from the Miami and on the waters of the Wabash, and that the loss of the Indians had been very inconsiderable. Another circumstance which may not be amiss to inform you of is that two Indians of the tribes taken prisoner last year went from here to Fort Washington last summer on a visit to their friends—there they saw the Chickasaw Indians who were on the expedition with us, who told them, that it was a folly for the Indians of the lakes, to be at war with us, that they themselves had been a long time in arms against the White people, but they at last found it their interest to live in peace with them—that their nation and the Choctaws would join the Americans to go against them if it should be necessary. these circumstances were reported by the above two Indians who returned to their Nation the last Autumn, and came up the river with me. This appears to have struck the Indians with such a panic that it has reached the Miami—who I am informed would make peace with the United States, if they had an opportunity— As it is necessary to permit some merchants to go into the Indian Towns, I have made choice of a few, who have entered into a bond of one thousand dollars, and to whom I have given licence for six Months— On this head I expect to receive some directions from the Governor, to whom I have wrote on the subject—The getting of firewood for the garrison has become very difficult, we are obliged to go at so great a distance for it, that it keeps the men on a constant fatigue, this together with some other inconveniencies we lay under by being so near the Town, would render it adviseable to move the Garrison, further up the River The Governor in my instructions directs me to try to obtain the consent of the Indians for the establishment of a Garrison at the Eel River or the Weya—I have not yet found matters sufficiently ripe to make the proposition but I believe that some presents would remove every difficulty that might exist. Since my writing the above I have received a letter from Colonel Wilkinson who directs me to send a couple of Spies to the Miami in order to get intelligence of the disposition of the Indians—I have engaged two confidential Indians who are to set off immediately and to return sometime in May. I have the honor to be & MAJOR GENERAL KNOX. P. S. We have on hand for about Six Months provision but the Indians who are every day in the Garrison consume some of it, and it is unavoidable—J F H (signed) JN" F. HAMTRAMCK 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, PHILADELPHIA, March 31* 1792 SIR, I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the twenty eighth instant.” While I lament that Circumstances prevent an Investigation into my Conduct by a Court of Enquiry, I can not but acquiesce in the Reasons you have assigned why it can not take Place, And I beg leave to present my thanks for the Desire to have gratified me, had it been practicable, which you have been pleased to manifest. In my Letter to you Sir, of the twenty sixth,” I expressed an Intention of retiring from the Army when the Enquiry should be over:-The only Reason I had for wishing to retain my Commission until that time was, that if any misconduct should appear,in the Course of the Enquiry, I might be amenable to a Court-Martial, which a Resignation would have precluded— The House of Representatives Sir, have directed an Enquiry into the Causes of the failure of the last Campaign to be made by a Committee of their own Body: * The same Reason that influenced me when a Court of Enquiry was contemplated, operates now with equal Force; and therefor it may be proper that I should still retain my Commission; but, as it will soon be requisite that some Person should be at the Head of the Army who is to continue to command it, it is necessary, Sir, that I should inform You explicitly, which I now do, of my fixed Resolution to resign the Moment that Enquiry is finished should no fault be found; that any Embarrassment which may exist, with respect to providing a Successor for me, may be removed. * Printed also in Smith (ed.), St. Clair Papers, II, 284–285. There is a draft in the St. Clair Papers (OSL). The differences between the draft and the Smith version, and the original letter from which the present text is taken, are numerous.  Be pleased to observe Sir, that my sole Object is to give Effect to public Justice, in the usual Way by a Court Martial, should it appear that, in any manner whatsoever, the Misfortunes of the last Campaign can be attributed to me—and it is the proper, and I believe the only Tribunal where military Crimes and Misconduct can be enquired into and punished; or, where an Officers Reputation, infinitely dearer than Life, can be vindicated.—Should the public Service, however, require that another Officer of the same Rank with me be appointed immediatly, I am ready to make the Resignation forthwith, notwithstanding that it may seem to proceed, and, at a distance, will be supposed to have arisen, from a Sense that the Volume of Calumny and Defamation, which is daily pouring from the Press into the public Ear, has too much foundation for me to meetit—that I shrink from the Consequences and chuse to shelter myself in a private Station:—I am ready Sir, upon this Occasion as I ever have been upon every other, to sacrifice every private and personal Consideration to the public Good. With every Sentiment of Respect I have the Honor to be Sir, Your most obedient Servant A*S* CLAIR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  From Maj Gen. Sº Clair 31* March 1792 * 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  PHILADELPHIA, April 4, 1792. DEAR SIR:—I have received two letters from you (the dates I cannot mention as I have them not at hand, but they are those relating to Darke ") for which I am very much obliged to you, and they come very opportunely—the first to take off any prejudice that might have laid hold of the mind of the President by Darke's letter to him,” and the other to present Darke in his proper colours to the Committee of Congress that are now sitting to inquire into the causes of the failure of the last campaign which as you have been good enough to permit me to consider not as confidential, I shall lay before them. The object of this committee is in truth to discover some cause of complaint against General Knox, at least so it seems to me; but it will answer the purpose of an inquiry into my conduct which I had requested of the President, but which it was impossible to obtain for want of officers of sufficient rank. On many occasions in the course of the business, your testimony would have been of great use and I am sorry that it cannot be had, not on that account only, but that it must have appeared how very useful you had been on the course of the campaign. Of that, however, I shall not lose sight, and I trust I shall be able to bring forward enough to serve for us both. The business of the Scioto Purchase has not been stirred in Congress. Judge Putnam and Mr. Cutler are both here, and on that of the Ohio Company, a Bill is reported * giving that Company seven hundred fifty thousand acres for the money they have already paid—granting them one hundred thousand acres in lieu of the donations, and an allowance to pay in a certain sum on Army Warrants. The Bill is not come from the Press or I would have sent you a copy. My health is still very far from being restored, but it is returning and now the fine season is set in I look forward to its reestablishment. I shall not again, however, commit it in another campaign, and have given the President notice that as soon as this inquiry is closed I shall resign, that he may provide me a successor in time. Who that will be, I cannot inform you, tho' probably it may be General Pinckney of South Carolina. As soon as I can do it with any conveniency, I propose to return to Fort Washington where I may possibly spend the Summer and then take a lasting farewell of the Western Territory. Congress has voted five thousand men,” but when they will be raised God only knows, and my fears—not for that country only, but the whole frontier—are not a little roused. Indeed, my dear Sir, much mischief I fear will be done before anything will be in readiness to counteract it. Pray remember me to General Wilkinson affectionately. He has written very handsomely of you to the Secretary of War. I should have written to him by this opportunity but have not time—this being scribbled in the Committee with a crowd about me and questions and answers that I am obliged to attend to. Adieu. Believe me ever with best wishes and very great regards, dear Sir, Your very humble servant, A. ST. CLAIR. TO COL. WINTHROP SARGENT. 
THE PRESIDENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR , UNITED STATES April 4th 1792. SIR. I have read and duly considered your letter of the 31'st ultimo.” The reasons you offer, for retaining your commission, until an opportunity should be presented, if necessary, of investigating your conduct, in every mode prescribed by law, would be conclusive with me, under any other circumstances than the present. But, the establishment of the troops allows only of one major general—You have manifested your intention of retiring, and the essential interests of the public require, that your successor should be immediately appointed, in order to repair to the frontiers. As the house of representatives have been pleased to institute an enquiry into the causes of the failure of the late expedition, I should hope an opportunity would thereby be afforded you, of explaining your conduct, in a manner satisfactory to the public and yourself. TO M GEN' Sº CLAIR  To Maj Gen. Sº Clair 4th April 1792. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT  PHILADELPHIA April 7th 1792 SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the fourth instant. Although I was very desirous Sir, to hold my Commission of Major General until the Enquiry by the Committee of the House of Representatives should be over, for the Reasons which I assigned, and which you are pleased to think have some Weight, yet the evident necessity of the Officers being appointed who is to command the Troops, in order to his repairing to the Frontiers, is certainly pressing and ought to silence, with me, every Wish of a mere personal nature; I do therefor Sir, now formally resign the Appointment of Major General. I have never Sir, entertained a doubt that an Enquiry into the Causes of the failure of the late Expedition, whether directed particularly to my Conduct, or to that connected with other Causes that may have operated, in whatever way it might be conducted, would not prove honorable to me and satisfactory to the public, as far as I was connected with it; but setting, as I do, a due value upon the public Opinion, and desirous not to lose that Place in the Esteem of the virtuous and intelligent of my fellow Citizens which I have long held, you will not wonder that, under existing Circumstances, a degree of anxiety, not only that an Enquiry should be made, but that every thing, capable of being misconstrued, should be avoided on my part.—I will own to you Sir, that the Desire of honest Fame has ever been the strongest Passion in my Breast—I have thought that I had merited it—and is all that I have to compensate me for the Sacrifice of a very independant Situation, and the best Years of my life devoted to the public Service, and the faithful Application of my Talents, such as they were, in every Situation in which I have been placed, with a Zeal bordering upon Enthusiasm.—I trust Sir, I shall yet enjoy it, while those who have attempted to disturb it will be forgotten, or remembered with indignation, and in their Bosoms, if they have feeling, Sensations may arise something similar to what Milton has described to have seized upon Satan when he discovered our first Parents in Paradise.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  FORT WASHINGTON June 9th 1792 MY DEAR SIR I enclose you Copies of my three last Letters * which passed through the wilderness—I do not know but that I ought to have tendered my Services to have performed the Duties of Adjº Gen' &c" if it should have been necessary until another appointment but you may be assured that if this was proper the Omission has arisen in no Deficiency of Inclination to promote as much as possible the public Interests and military Service particularly—Perhaps if the Commanding General arrives he may direct Montres to those Duties, but upon a Presumption that you may not be acquainted with His littleness of Capacity for even very trifling Concerns I should hold myself culpable if I did not express to you an opinion that he is the veriest Blockhead in Creation with a Vanity and mischievious Impertinence that can be exceeded only by his supreme Ignorance—He dashes at every thing without knowing anything and stepping out of Line of the military ventures sometimes to preach such Doctrine to the Inhabitants of this Territory as has been calculated to make weak men seditious and should have been noticed in a very summary way would my Informants have inclined to come forward—Col Hodgsdon who knows much of him has made me some Communications and tells me that he is at present very much engaged in persuading the Army that my military appointments has been rec" in great Disgust beyond the mountains and particularly in Philadelphia while the Fool at the same Time is treating me with fairest Face–And that I believe to be his Rule of Conduct for all Characters whatever— Will you give me Leave my Dear Sir again to mention Doctor Brown º' to you as a man of great humanity and Attention in his Profession and who is very desirous of continuing in the Army, but holding the office of Surgeon last Campaign he feels himself degraded in the appointment as a mate and quits—His Assiduity Education and knowledge of the mathematics would well qualify him as an Artillerist, which if it might be consistent to commission him in that Line and permit him to be Surgeons Mate also I am persuaded would be highly gratifying to him—Might it not Sir be proper Economy in some Instances—where there are small Garrisons in unhealthy Climates to indulge this Deviation of common Rule? I will only take the Liberty to add, that the Army wants very much men of Doctor Brown's Assiduity as Surgeons.— Upon the Subject of the Powder of last Campaign which in one Instance was complained of to me by a Major Clerk, I believe Col Hodgsdon will produce to you some additional Certificates of its goodness—It may very easily I think be conceived that it was very good at Philadelphia Pittsburgh and this Place and that some of it might have been otherwise in action for even at the military store where great Care was observed the frequent Rains must have damaged it upon the march, and when once it was issued out to the soldiers it was immediately most shamefully neglected—Notwithstanding pointed and reiterated Orders upon this Subject I scarcely ever was upon the grand Parade that I had not cause of very great Complaint from the waste and Inattention to ammunition— The Report of the Committee of Congress for Inquiry &c" has I perceive come very hard upon Col Hodgsdon—It Appears to me that Every Person acquainted intimately with his Conduct in the office of Q' Gen' must do him the Justice to acknowledge that at least he was very indefatigable in the Discharge of the Duties thereof and he certainly has been one of the most rigid Economists of public Monies and Property that I ever was acquainted with—his Office however appears to me an Arduous one and I know of no military or Civic Appointment that I deem as difficult to be discharged in Propriety as that of Q Master General or that I should with so much Diffidence to undertake—I have had my Dear Sir and expect still to be subjected to Difficulties in my Endeavours to preserve Harmony between the civic and Military in this Country—you know there will always be some young men in Military Life and amongst the Citizens are characters void of Probity and Consideration—A Prosecution has been Commenced by one Blanchard & Smith at the Instance of two Army Certifiers against a Mr Harrison for some Stripes inflicted by his Direction under the Prescription of Gen' Wilkinsons Orders—'tis not for me to judge of the Propriety of those Orders but I know that as those men had voluntarily subjected themselves to martial Law their Redress ought to be through that channel—and upon application of Gen' Wilkinson devised means to lay aside the Suit—Blanchard and Smith I believe to be bad Characters—the former very vile but he had some how or other by the Imprudence of the Clerk “ of the Court become possessed of the Court Records and presumed to issue Precepts in his own Name as the Clerk—This man is a practicing Attorney which, in itself independant from the Consideration of his being notoriously unprincipled, would render it very improper to vest him with Authority to issue Precepts and institute Suits at Law upon which his Existence depends— A Statute of the Territory declares that any Person presuming to exercise Powers &c" to which by Law he is not authorized shall be deemed guilty of Usurpation and Fined not exceeding one hundred Dollars ”—As the Ordinance of Congress vests me & me alone at present with the Authority of making all officers * and this man had never recº my Commission I conceived him guilty of Usurpation and have desired Judge Symmes to proceed against him accordingly.” In the mean while appointing a Gentleman of Discretion to discharge the Duties of the Clerk of the Court until the Return of Mr. Ludlow who had been appointed to that office by the Governour and I am in hopes that there will be an End to vexatious Suits and Prosecutions—but I expect a violent Representation of the Business may be transmitted to you and perhaps many public officers—I can I know justify myself, but the misfortune is that such Complaints are sometimes made and tho' not deemed by the Persons receiving them of sufficient consequence to demand or authorize an Investigation yet capable to effect and prejudice their minds against the Person complained of and do him consequently material Injury—I shall however continue with out Dread of Issue to discharge all my Duties according to the best of my Abilities and If I err tho' I may subject myself to Censure I shall have the Consciousness that my Heart is not in Fault With great Respect I am your affectionate WINTHROP SARGENT

JUDGE SYMMES TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  CINCINNATI July the 6th 1792. MY DEAR SIR. Some accounts of Indian Expenses will be presented to you probably by Major Wanderburgh, and which are represented to me to be very Enormous.* I have reason to believe that great abuses have been committed in the Department at Vincennes, and Shall immediately write to Major Hamtranck to cause an Inquiry and present me with all the information he can obtain—Major Vanderburgh wished me to examine those Accounts, but as the Transactions were all during the Governour's presence in the Territory, I declined it. And indeed, I feel myself very much at a loss how to conduct myself in Indian Affairs. The Acts & Resolves of Congress Appear to me to have constituted the Governour, Superintendent ex officio—and required of me (or I mistake them) to discharge all the duties in his Absence. But the Instructions given to general Wilkinson upon this Subject,” and the late Mission of Gen' Putnam,” leave me strangely at a loss how to determine. - The Indian Goods &c" subject to my Controul, and committed to a Storekeeper here by Mr. Hodgaon (with the approbation of the Governour I suppose) have been directed by that gentleman to be delivered to General Putnam in consequence of an order of your's received upon the Ohio river as he was ascending it. I have told the Store keeper that this Order from the War office Should have been presented to me—that from Inclination and Duty I was perfectly disposed to promote by every possible means the Intentions of Government and would upon Application give him directions to deliver over all the Indian Goods to General Putnam. The enclosed letter from Major Hamtranck " I shall communicate to General Putnam. If he is the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, it Should have been addressed to him, but I suppose the Major has not been informed upon this Subject. I humbly conceive Sir, that very great inconvenience and even Injury might accrue to the public from the want of proper information—but you may rest perfectly assured that no exertions of mine will be wanting to prevent it.

SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE PRESIDENT, CINCINNATI COUNTY OF HAMILTON AND TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES NORTH WEST OF THE RIVER OHIO. July the 6th 1792. SIR, I do myself the honour to transmit by Major Vigo,” a copy from the public records of the Territory of the United States, north west of the river Ohio, to the 30" of June inclusive.” The long absence of two of the judges from the Government, has prevented the adoption of laws for more than the six months last past, which is considered and lamented as a very great misfortune to the territory— Since closing my official communications sir, Major Vigo has presented to me the enclosed petition from the people of Vincennes which I beg leave to lay before Congress.” Observing that the petitioners are generally in very indigent circumstances—much attached to the United States, and that the whole expense of resurveying their ancient possessions, will, by an estimate of the surveyor, amount to about one thousand dollars. With every sentiment of the highest respect, I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient, and most devoted servant, WINTHROP SARGENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR [OHS : Sargent Papers : C 50] CINCINNATI July 12th, 1792 I have made my Dear Sir for you in great Haste the enclosed Extracts from some late Dispatches— I have long been persuaded that the Indians (many of them) about the Lakes and the Illinois might be detached from the Nations at War And I believe a man of address upon the Mississippi would not only produce this good but in some considerable Degree influence the Spaniards to prevent an improper Countenance being shown by them to our Enemies Mayet mentioned in Lagesse's" Speech is a most essential Scoundrel but necessary absolutely to Government and there is nothing too daring for the Rascal to Undertake—I know him well and Commissioned him by advice of the Governour because we Knew if he was not for us he would be most decidedly against us— The Indians very much fear him— Col Hamilton promised me when in Philadelphia to report upon a Petition of mine that was refered to him for Compensation whilst discharging the Duties of Governour in this Territory and which has accumulated my Expenses in a manner very serious to myself—I had  Encouragement not only from him but the Secretary of State that there was no Doubt of proper Provision being made for me upon this Business but I hear nothing more of it—If without too much Trouble you can satisfy me whether Col Hamilton will or not report upon the Petition I shall esteem it a very great Favour *—I have presumed twice to write to him upon the Subject” but he has not been good enough to respond I know the multiplicity & magnitude of his Avocations or suppose they may be immense but nevertheless I must wish that I may be informed whether he has or will report to Congress and I conceive I may presume to ask it— Be pleased to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs Knox believe me with most respectful Attachment & Esteem Dear Sir Your obedient and very humble Servant Private WINTHROP SARGENT HON” GENERAL KNOX Secretary of War Philadelphia  Col' Sargent July 12th 1792 private x 
THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  WAR DEPARTMENT July 23° 1792 SIR Your several favours of the 10th of April “ and 16 of May * have been duly received. It is to be hoped that the party at Gallipolis is sufficient for the protection of the settlement, and that the other settlements are as well protected as the nature of the case may require and also the settlements below. If however it should appear otherwise, you are hereby authorized in the absence of the Governor to call out such portions of militia as shall be indispensibly necessary for the defensive protection of any settlement in the territory of the United States North West of the Ohio The militia called out, or to be called out (excepting the scouts or spies so termed) to be on the pay and rations of the troops of the United States, without any allowance for Clothing The militia to be mustered on the entrance and termination of their service. I shall direct Major General Wayne to order escorts to the Governor, or Secretary acting as such in the absence of the Governor, or the judges of the Western Territory when on public business and when the said escorts can be furnished consistently with the public service "— While the pacific overtures to the hostile Indians are pending, offensive operations against them ought to be prevented either by any of the people of the Western Territory, or any other persons from the South eastern side of the River. The conduct of the party mentioned in your letter of the tenth of May to Judge Symmes,” has been noticed to Brigadier General Wilkinson and he is particularly instructed thereon. Your letter of the 16” of May announcing that you decline the office of Adjutant and Inspector General has given me great pain—I have communicated your decision to the President of the United States who is in Virginia The military bill was long detained by discussions in Congress—It was intended by the Executive that the Adjutant General should have had the rank of Lieutenant Colonel—but in the collisions which happened in the passage of the bill it was struck out and it was afterwards judged inexpedient to attempt to restore it. I lament the circumstance, as it has prevented the public from receiving your aid in so important a station, for which your talents in my judgment eminently fitted you— I have the honor to be Sir with great esteem Your humble servant.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT  WAR DEPARTMENT August 16 1792 SIR I have the honor to submit a copy of a Letter from Brigadier  General Putnam of the 14” Ultimo; * & another of the same date from Brigadier General Wilkinson containing enclosures,” and I shall transmit copies of the several papers which have been received, to Major General Wayne, as I concieve it highly proper for him to be informed of every thing relative to the objects of his command. I confess I think the accuracy of the information of the prisoners to be questioned—their sphere of observation must have been very small indeed—I think however there cannot be a doubt about Trueman. We may expect to hear of the reception of Captain Hendricks daily, as he probably arrived at the Miami River of Lake Erie about the latter end of June. That the Shawanese and some others are inveterate, I have no doubt, but I think if they have fairly explained to them the ample message sent by Trueman, that the mass of the hostile Indians will probably accede to a Treaty—But in any event the Executive of the United States will be considered by all impartial and moderate men as having taken every rational expedient to bring matters to an amicable termination." I intimated to General Wayne some time since that the lateness of the Season would probably render it inexpedient to employ any Chickesaws or Choctaws this year. I have the honor to transmit a copy of my letter to Governor Blount of the 15 instant.” The affairs in the South Western quarter are in a very ill position if Colonel Arthur Campbells letter is to be entirely credited—I have the honor to enclose a copy of his Letter to Lieut Governor Wood who transmitted it to me.  The Governor of Virginia set out on the 25. Ultimo for the South Western frontier. Since writing the above I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 13 instant *—the letter of General Putnam " relative to the post on the Muskingum and the Fish Carriers." Speech are now enclosed I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Your most obed' Serv" H KNOX 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE PRESIDENT TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  MoUNT VERNON Aug 22 1792 DEAR SIR, In my letter of the 15" " I acknowledged the receipt of yours of the 11";" since which your dispatches of the 16” are come to hand, and convey but a gloomy prospect of peace with the Indians, in either hemisphere. but then the necessity of preparing more vigorously if possible for the dernier resort. That the Western Indians are stimulated to acts of hostility on one side and every mean which can be devised to set aside the treaties wº" exist between the Southern Indians and the U. States & to encourage the former to break with us on the other admits of no doubt in my mind; and that it may be a concerted plan between cert" Powers to check the growth of this rising Country, is far from improbable—diabolical as it may Seem.— The enclosure of Gen' Putnams letter of the 9” of July,” enables me (which I could not do before) to form some idea of his proposition to establish a Post on the Muskingham; and though I shall give no decided opinion on this particular case, my sentiments, generally, with respect to Posts, are not changed—and are shortly these. that except for the preservation of Stores, and the security of convoys upon communi" they are of no use but to protect the people within them—for unless the Garrison is of such strength, & can detach in such force, as to bid defiance to the enemy it is always cooped up.– Except for the purposes I have mentioned, of what advantage are Forts Hamilton, Sº Clair & Jefferson?—” The strength of Stationary parties are soon discovered by the Indians and when discovered, are liable to be cut off, unless they confine themselves solely to the defence of the Post—& of what avail would this be on the Muskingham or elsewhere?—Posts can be insulted or avoided at the option of the enemy in a covered Country—but the best vigilence of the most cautious Ene[my] cannot prevent scouting parties falling on their trail.-Besides, we shall never be respectable at any point if the Troops are divided, & subdivided for the quietude of particular settlements or neighbourhoods:—nor will they ever be disciplined, and under due subordination whilst they are scattered over the Country in small parties under subaltern Officers; except when they are employed in Ranging, which is an essential part of their Military educat" in the Service for which they are designed.— If all the measures which have been pursued by Governm" to convince the hostile Indians of the just & honorable intention of the U States towards them should prove ineffectual we may certainly calculate upon a powerful opposition from this combind force; in which case, we shall not only be unprepared to penetrate their Country, this Year, but there appears to me to be very little prospect of doing it early in the next; unless there can be some stimulus to the recruiting Service;—and the Officers absolutely restrained from enlisting improper men—for I am told, notwithstanding the pointed instructions which have been issued to them on this head, that boys in many instances, and the worst miscreants in others are received: to the last of which may be attributed the number of desertions that are reported to the War Office.—Under this view of the matter, your intimation to Gen' Wayne respecting the Chicasaws and Choctaws was prudent & proper; but I conceive, nevertheless, if a few of each Southern Nation say a six or 8 respectable characters was to visit & remain with the army as long as should be agreeable to themselves—Be well fed & cloathed—& in all respects treated with attention & kindness, it would be an effectual inducement to the coming of the number that might be required next year? I perceive by Mº Belli" " letter that the difference between supplying the Troops with their Rations by Contract, and by a purchasing Comm” must be very great indeed, although he has not given the Wages, & other charges of the latter gentry.—I am of opinion that the  difference in favor of the latter will be found from the nature of things much greater on the exterior than it would be in the interior Country— and as the public pay for all lost provisions (by the enemy) is at the expence of Stores Guards &c" it is a matter worthy of serious investigation & consequent decision.—Consult therefore with the Secretary of the treasury, & act as the result shall appear best The hair must have stood on Major S-head,” & a stake full in his view, when his letter of the 8” of July was writing to Gen' Wilkinson, or the style of it would certainly have been varied.—With esteem & regard I am–D Sir Yr" &c."

SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR, Private CINCINNATI October 29th 1792 MY DEAR GEN' Captain Mayette * will hand you a Letter of Introduction—he has been commissioned by me in this Country not only from the recommendations of the Governour and the high Confidence placed in him apparantly (which can be evinced to you by the Copy of Instructions refered to in the Letter Which he bears) but from what I deemed proper policy—for if he is not for us he will be decidedly against us—and his Influence is very considerable amongst the Indians not only upon the Illionois but with the Kickapoos and I believe also with many other hostile Tribes—he is a most daring fellow and has obtained and maintained his Consequence by the “Ultimo ratio”—at divers Times and places he has cut & been cut down in Contests for Sovereignty by the tawney Sons of this Country and I am confident they stand much in Awe of him—The British and Spaniards I have no Doubt would purchase him at a considerable price and but for the flattering Distinctions we have paid him he probably would have struck up a Bargain—He has as I have observed to you a Commission and I understand some Idea that pay is or ought to be annexed to it and probably Govern" might Find it for their Interest so to establish the matter. La Chase” is a very sad Dog also living upon the Illinois at an important point capable & willing of mischief but has lived without creating much Complaint since the Governour was upon the Mississippi—It appears to me that it would be good policy to purchase him too—of the other Indians I know nothing “Ducoine” excepted—he talks of his Kaskaskians but in fact they can only be hunted up in other worlds For I do not imagine a Doz" of them are to be found in this—I believe him of no Consequence or Influence and he is a monstrous beggarly rascal even for an Indian and an Arrent Paltroon—Knowing thus much of those Characters I thought it incumbent on me Officially & confidentially to mention it to you for they are all my very good Friends— - I shall not presume to say anything upon this indian Treaty even in a private Letter For public Servants are to be silent upon public measures—my Friend Mº Heckenwelder has I believe rendered every Service he could upon the Occasion and as I am informed indeed been the Treaty maker.—My Opinions, nor no mans Opinions will I am persuaded every biass or influence Yours unless supported by much & good Authority but in Confidence I shall venture to believe and to declare to you that from the Knowledge which you may acquire of this Business you will be induced to think Gen' Putnam better calculated for all other Services than Indian treaty making—you will not condemn me for thus expressing myself to you—it is to you alone and I have a very great Respect for the Talents which he possesses— If Governour Sº Clair is in Philadelphia I shall be sorry that I have expressed myself to you respecting the Indians because he knew them as well as Mayette—as he might not be there I wished my Dear Sir to impart to you all I knew of them— I am my Dear Sir with much Attachment very respectfully & affectionately yours W.

ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE INHABITANTS OF GALLIPOLIS  CINCINNATI COUNTY OF HAMILTON AND TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES NORTHWEST OF THE OHIO Noor 23d 1792. I have to acknowledge your letter of the 23% ult.* received a few days since and to reply with that degree of frankness and candour which I trust will ever mark my charactar. In order to make you perfectly acquainted how far and intimately I may have been connected in the Land Transactions of which you complain it will be proper to inform you that the rev" Mr Cutler and myself were solicited in the year 1787 to attempt the purchase of a Tract of Country within this Government to the value of one million of Dollars for a number of Gentlemen associated under the name of the name of the Ohio company ”—that upon this occation we so far extended our views at the particular request of Col. William Duer as to ask for, and obtained the preemption of all the Lands from the seventh range of Townships to the Sciota, to the Ohio river and a certain northern boundary, which preemption (with the exception of one million and a half of acres the reserve Lots in the ratio ordered by Congress and two complete Townships for the purposes of an University being within the Eighth and seventeenth ranges Ohio River and a given Boundery upon the North) was to be to the benefit of Col. Duer, M. Cutler and myself and our associates * Under these circumstances it was agreed upon by the concerned that Royal Flint Esquire should attempt to negotiate this Preemption right in Europe agreeably to such Instructions as he might receive from Mº Cutler and myself.” Col. Duer was authorized in case of Disability in M* Flint to appoint another agent” with our concurrence but to be governed by our Instructions, and none were ever given to justify the sale of a single Foot of Land, that have come to my Knowledge—we had not bought therefore could not sell—The very instrument you allude to and of which you tell me you have a “legal copy” most explicitly declares this.” When it was determined to send an agent to Europe the necessary credentials and informations of this country were required I furnished myself a survey of some parts thereof, accurate and descending very much to minutia in order to prevent all possibility of deception there was not a hill or vale in the whole compass of this survey which was not noted and the particular description of soil, timber water courses, &c. annexed—a general map also was made out from the best informations which could be obtained, but never pretended to have been correct. The copy of agreement between] Duer, Cutler and myself prefaced and founded upon preemption right only—and our agreement with the Board of Treasury obligatory of actual pay met before we could demand a single acre of ground although it is I think there provided that we should obtain Deeds for each sixth part of the soil upon paying the value thereof into the public Treasury: With such Documents, and the express instruction that no considerable pecuniary risk was to be made our agent was to have gone forward—The fortunes of M* Cutler myself and our associates collectively were poor and inadequate to hazard—the avowal of this was made to Col. Duer at a considerable meeting of the concerned and a positive Declaration that we would not adventure beyond the sum of 250 £. sterling—the calculation for one equal moiety of an agent's necessary expenses in Europe for one year—if his prospects had been flattering we were at our own option to have made future and further provision for his longer continuance—He was to offer only our preemption right in the aggragate or such proportions as we had agreed to receive and pay for to Congress—Deeds for which were to be executed when we received the purcase money and not till then. No instructions ever were given to Col. Duer to authorize any person in Europe to receive the purchase monies. In a Trust of such magnitude I should have consulted all my associates—neither did I ever authorize the continuance of an agent in Europe more than one year or hold myself responsible for expences beyond the above expressed sum of two hundred and fifty pounds which has already I believe been discharged by my attorney. That you are Gentlemen in a very embarrassed situation I can readily conceive and that in equity you should long since have been put in possession of the property you came in quest of not however in consequence of any engagements of mine—This cannot be admitted—and your candour Gentlemen will I persuade myself from an impartial consideration of the foregoing statement induce you to acquit me of being in any degree accessary to your misfortunes. I have seldom in my life formed engagements that I have not performed—and never voluntarily forfeited one—In no instances whatever within my memory have I pledged myself to you Gentlemen, either directly or indirectly—If M Barlow or any other man has made use of my name in the sale of lands to you it is your misfortune but not my fault—If Col. Duer has sent him to France to negociate such a Sale,” the authorities should have been critically examined— it would appeared I believe that they were neither derived from me or Mº Cutler—the only authority vested in Col. Duer by us was the appointment of an agent under the instructions before mentioned and the proper attentions upon your part would have evinced this in france and the want of them has made you accessary in a degree to the consequences of the impositions you now experience—To relieve you however as much as possible shall be my endeavour—Considering you as Citizens of this Territory it is my duty so to do—As foreigners you have an additional claim upon me—but none upon the principles you imply– Mr Cutler and myself are poor in fortune; if it was otherwise I should have no objections to your essay of the “means” proposed— Our friends I know will believe us at all times ready and willing to do good and to do justice to all men without the coercion of law—But whatever Gentlemen shall be your final determination I shall be happy, and I repeat it, to use my best endeavours for your service—you have only to point out the mode. I know but few of the attendant circumstances of your being brought into this Country or your consequent disappointments thereupon— Col” Duer has always been so absorbed in business that I could derive no information from him—when I was over the mountains however in the Winter of 1790 I learned so much as to be convinced that you must be distressed beyond his or any individual capacity to relieve and would therefore have prevailed upon him to come forward with an ingenuous representation to Congress which I then imagined and am now convinced must be your dernier resort—but from some European expectations he declined it—It was my intention to have urged this advice until I had succeeded or come forward myself with the business but my public duties suddenly called me to the Territory—tho' not before I had reason to believe your situation would have been laid  before Congress in that session. Col. Duers disposition to your settlement is I make no doubt generous and good but he at present is deprived of the power to serve you. With the conduct of M. Barlow I am told he is much displeased and indeed in some instances that he thinks it nefarious—for my own part I have always thought him a man of integrity—But let the management of those Gentlemen have been what it may, yet they have it not in their power to make amends—if one thousand guineas would establish you happy I believe it is not in their ability to command it. I should therefore advise a candid impartial statement of your situation to Congress—handle me as you please (for if I have done wrong I ask no favor) I will transmit it as early as possible and spare no exertion to obtain for you the completion of all your reasonable wishes—” W SARGENT CAPTAIN ROME Dr PETIT & GENTLEMEN OF GALLIPOLIS.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , PHILADELPHIA December 5* 1792 SIR, Your Letter of the 21* September,” enclosing a Copy of an Order of the Senate relative to the Salaries, Fees and Emoluments of Persons holding Offices under the United States, and the actual Expenses and Disbursements attending the Execution of their respective Offices for one Year,” came to hand a few days ago:-You desire from me an Account of the Offices I hold, as Governor of the western Territory and superintendant of Indian Affairs, embracing those Objects, and for the period therein mentioned to end the first day of October last past.—in Answer, Sir, I have to observe that, by the Resolve of Congress of the third of October 1787” the Office of Superintendant of Indian Affairs for the northern Department was united with that of Governor of the western Territory, and the Compensation that had been attached to that Office was added to the Salary of the Governor, making in the whole two thousand Dollars.--that, since the establishment of the present Government, there has been no Appointment of a Superintendant—and that, hitherto there has been no Fees, nor Emolument of any kind beside the Salary. It is not possible for me to give you, at this time an Account of the Expenses that regularly attend the discharge of the Office annually— nor of the Disbursements I have actually made—the last have been heavy, and have absorbed nearly the whole of the Salary. But, as a part, at least, of those Disbursements are out of the usual Course, having been incurred in the discharge of Duties specially directed by Congress, they cannot be fairly stated as incident to the Office, and I expect a reimbursement. The regular Expenses of the Governor will, however, be considerable for some Years to come; for, the Settlements are so distant and unconnected with each other—the Communications between them so difficult—the Manners of the People so dissimilar, as well as their Languages different, that, it seems to me, to be able to accommodate Laws to their different Situations, it will be necessary necessary for the Governor of that Territory to visit all the Settlements once a Year at least, notwithstanding that the extremes of them are nearly a thousand Miles apart.—His Expenses on those Occasions cannot be estimated at less than five hundred Dollars, especially when it is considered that, in the french Settlements bordering on the Wabash and Missisippi, Money is of less value than, perhaps, in any other part of the World:—That, together with a small Sum for Stationery, House Rent, and Postage of Letters will form the whole Disbursements for the Goverment properly, and should be considered as an annual Expense, altho, in present Circumstances, it may not be incurred. The Disbursements in that part which respects the Indians cannot be conjectured, as they depend upon Circumstances entirely unforeseen—there is at present no regular Expense attending it, that I know of, except a Salary of sixty Pounds p" Annum to an Interpreter at Pittsburgh—He was appointed by me; but, whether he is continued or dissmissed, I am not informed.

The greatest Number consisted of industrious Men from almost every Class of the Society, who, after having lost a considerable Portion of their Fortune collected the Fragments thereof in Order to go and enjoy in a free and quiet Country all the Advantages so publickly so pompously announced by the Scioto Company and far from the Scene of Danger they longed to be improving that fertile Soil or to cultivate there the peaceful Arts to which they had devoted their Lives. The Purchasers were confirmed in their Expectation and secured against their Apprehensions by all the apparently legal Documents shewn to them together with the Means of Seduction that were employed in Addition to the Solidity of the Titles, upon which they became Purchasers. The most striking Proof of this Assertion is the considerable Number of Purchases made by Men, of every Professions with a Degree of Confidence and Goodfaith very uncommon in Business of this Nature—. It must be owned, that, what compleated the Seduction was the well known Character of the Nation to which belonged the Individuals, with whom they contracted and the high Opinion, which generally and So justly prevails in France with Respect to the Goodfaith and Candour of the Americains and also the Expectation and Belief that Frenchmen would easily obtain Justice and Redress from the Government of the United States against fraud and Deception. The Emigration, which began in the Month of February in the Year One thousand seven hundred and Ninety lasted untill the latter End of the Month of August in the same year; Three of the first four ships, which arrived to America met together at Alexandria about the Beginning of May; soon after their Arrival, they were visited by some Agents of W* Duer, Superintendant of the Scioto Company Those Agents were authorized to treat with them in the Name of the said Company, and to procure them the Means of reaching the place of their Destination The Result of that Negociation was a Contract executed between W” Duer in the Name of his Company, and the French Inhabitants. By one of the Articles of which said Contract great Care was taken to remove the well grounded fears, which had been inspired to the Emigrants on their Arrival with Respect to the Incursions of the Indians into the Country where they were going to settle, although the pretended Peace and Tranquillity of the said Country had been so highly extolled to them when in France. The Emigrants left Alexandria towards the End of the Month of June, but were detained in Winchester under sundry Pretences untill the Month of September following. They were met at that Place by Passengers from several ships, and at last arrived at Gallipolis about the End of the Month of October of the same year. Since their Arrival there they have been reduced to cultivate round the Limits of that Town some small Portions of ground, which could not be refused to their Importunities, altho' it is that the said same Ground is the Property of another Company, which now threatens to dispossess Your Petitioners. Out of a thousand or twelve hundred persons, who seduced by the advantageous Offers of the Scioto Company emigrated into America, Four hundred only arrived at Gallipolis, and yet that Number is now reduced to Two hundred and fifty Individuals, who from their Confidence in the Scioto Company and especially in the Equity of the United States have struggled against Obstacles of every kind and braved the incessant Dangers of Savage War. The enormous and irreparable Losses, which they have suffered by that War, the still more irreparable Loss of three years of their time, the Impossibility they have experienced of employing the Workmen, whom they had brought from France at a great Expence and the Indemnities, they have been obliged to allow them not being able to fulfill their former Engagements with them, have almost entirely exhausted all their Resources so, that they have obtained nothing from their considerable Expences but the clearing of few Spots of ground, which are hardly sufficient to afford them a bare Subsistance. What other Resolution can be adopted by strangers entirely ignorant of the Laws, formalities and even the Language of the new Country, which they have made their own, who are forced to struggle with so many Disadvantages against a numerous and powerful Body, but that of applying to the Sovereign Power and implore its equitable Interference and Patronage. The Government will not suffer an Advantage to be taken before their own Eyes of the Credulity of an unsuspecting people. Congress will not suffer them to be dragged from the fields which they have cultivated and from the Dwellings which they have so painfully raised They therefore humbly request, That they may be maintained and secured in the Possession of the Lands, which they have cleared with the Sweat of their Brows and often watered with their Blood; That the Government will be pleased, to grant them Lands adequate to their original Purchase, They leave to its Generosity to determine and Decide upon the Indemnities to which they hope, they will be thought intitled by their Fidelity and Zeal and by the Losses which they have Suffered on Account of the War.

Private Business can not justify their being away I am persuaded— I have tried the effect of this in vain for myself and have I believe sacrificed all the property I had in the World because I could not obtain a short Leave of Absence and dared not to take it— I trust that you will be in Philadelphia upon the Judges Arrival and during his Continuance there—he bears not to you more than myself I believe any good will notwithstanding he may sometimes put on a fair outside—And against some men there is scarcely the possibility of being armed—the man of Cunning who will not come forward but by Insinuation and inuendo is a dangerous Foe—Conscious as I am that I have ever discharged my Duties in Fidelity I could dread no Search or research directed by public Authority and effected in a fair handed Style—but [not] of a man who could receive a letter from one person, The Seal unbroken—search into the Contents & eface the same and hand it over to the Character for whom it had been intended in that order, and insinuate that the violations thereupon had been made by a man who never had any Knowledge of the same, or even that there was such a Letter in Existence requesting at the same time that his name might not be called in question “Nil niger est—hunc tu—Caveto”— I believe you have already been informed that this Business produced two cavalier Letters from Gen' W. & myself—that serious Consequences might have ensued but for the Gen's Discovery of this mans Iniquity which was communicated to Us with an Injunction of ‘Secrecy 7– I hope my Dear Sir you will do me the Favour to write me soon and give me Information when I may expect you in the Territory certain With every Sentiment of Respect and Esteem I have the honour to be your most obedient Humble Servant WINTHROP SARGENT HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR Sº CLAIR  February 6* 1793 Private

CLAIR (OSL:St. Clair Papers: ALS) CINCINNATI February 12th 1793 DEAR SIR I have necessarily been induced to write you very much of late relative to this govern' and must proceed—many of my letters however have gone on by that honourable Gentleman Judge Symmes and may be mislaid or otherwise disposed of—for I can suspect him of any meaness, but I have covered the Letters to General Knox— enclosed was one full of Solicitation and remonstrance to prevent him Leaving the Territory at this Time when he should be preparing to hold the Court in the western Counties and another to the Secretary complaining that they were ineffectual and representing our Territory as totally without their honours"— I mentioned to you in a private Letter my having issued a new Commission for the Court of common pleasin this County during pleasure;” This I have reason to think Symmes is Surcharged as a matter of Complaint—the enclosed Letter will tend to explain the Business if Explanation be necessary—You will have no Doubt I am persuaded that I have and always do act from Honour and Conscience and will be capable by being on the Spot of making proper representations— I have not looked over the records to observe whether your Commissions to the Court were during pleasure but knowing that you would when you thought proper supersede any Appointments and knowing also in this Country it might be necessary so to do I did not hesitate a moment as to the Style—For if the power to displace rests not with the Governors Officers in the worst Events may be so permanent as to produce great public Taxing—The general Court is but annual any where and not known at all in the two western Counties—No Crime against the public or even the most flagitious Conduct of a popular magistrate could be adduced to Conviction and Sentence I am persuaded in the County of Hamilton—that great invaluable blessing of Trial by Juries I shall convince your Excellency personally as I think it my Duty to do when you shall come on is perverted to a Curse in Hamilton County and I can I think demonstrate to any honest impartial man that the Solemn Ties of sacred Oaths and Obligation they might range uncontrouled—Licentiousness is their Characteristic and the magistrate who shall dare to enforce the Laws which are adopted will of Course become the Object of their highest Displeasure—under this which seems a pretty general Impression here you cannot expect the due Exertion—Notwithstanding the violent outrages which have been committed and which have in part been detailed to you the Court have been comparitively Silent—a Deposition declares very great Disorders at a house particularly pointed out was laid before them refered to the grand Jury and there it rested to the great Encouragement of similar Conduct—If the Justices, as they have a legal Right to do, had themselves examined Evidences they would have found sufficient matter to have demanded security for the peace and good Behavior of a number of suspected Characters and future good Consequences would have accrued—but candidly I believe they will at all Events go with the multitude even to do Evil—I wish to show tham all possible respect and have endeavoured to do it—I have endeavoured to consider them—the magistrates in all Instances as the best and first men in the different Counties—And a public circular Letter upon the Journal demonstrates this—Old Symmes has also received from me more Attention and Deference than his Conduct either to You or me in the public Line merited—in private Consideration he has and will evermore I dare say conduct himself like a rascal— The Court of common pleas in this County have the most positive proof in themselves that I can not ever remove men from Office from personal Considerations for they have suffered me to be most grossly insulted before them without the notice and attention which was indeed due to their own Dignity as a court—To your appointments I have always been induced also to very great consideration from delicate and I trust proper principles—If M“millan had been of my own appointment I would have removed him within the Garrison Boundaries & ſhe would have] voluntarily subjected himself to martial Law as a follower of the Army—I had some conversation with him as to the Compatability of his remaining a magistrate under such Disabilities but told him I should not displace him from the Considerations before mentioned—this was a long while past and before he had changed his Abode—You will not I know deem me wrong in this much writing you when you take into consideration my motives— I am my Dear Sir affectionately and with very great Respect Your humble Servant WINTHROP SARGENT P. S. If old Symmes gets a private Interview with the President he will attempt to stab me in the Dark—unless your Excellency can guard me—I trust 'tis in your power—I say trust as Turner writes old Symmes—so Symmes says “Governor Sº Clair is out of Joint with the president” GOVERNOR Sº CLAIR
THE PRESIDENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  UNITED STATES Feby 12th 1793– SIR, The Hostile Indians having requested that all the Treaties which have been entered into with the several Western & Northern Tribes, may be produced at the proposed meeting at Sandusky"— Therefore in order, that the Commissioners, for the proposed treaty, should be fully informed on the subject of their mission, it would be proper, that a summary view, should be formed of all the Treaties which have been made with the aforesaid Indians, from the treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 to the present time inclusively—and any wellgrounded exceptions to the validity of any treaty to be noticed— The parties on both sides which made the several treaties—and in cases of the relinquishment of lands, the consideration given should be specified— And perhaps, to have a more comprehensive view of the subject, it would be necessary to extend the inquiry prior to the time above mentioned, so as to comprehend any treaties with the French, relatively to the cession of lands by the Indians north-west of the Ohio — In the inquiry, it will be necessary to note as far as the information shall be attainable, the acknowledged proprietors of the lands relinquished to the whites, as may have been conceded generally by other Indians bordering on the tribes who may have relinquished the said lands— I request that you will undertake this subject, and lay the result before me at as early a period as conveniently may be— (signed) G W THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES-  To The Atty Gen' of the U.

MEMORIAL FROM GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO CONGRESS , [February 18, 1793) To the Senate and the House of Representatives of the united States the Memorial of Arthur Sº Clair Governor of the Territory of the united States north west of the Ohio respectfully representeth That your Memorialist, in the execution of certain Duties, and the performance of sundry Services prescribed to him by Congress, made Disbursements, and contracted Debts, which considerably exceeded the Funds placed in his Hands. That his Accounts were presented to the late Board of Treasury in due time, but were not passed, because it did not appear that all the Items charged had actually been paid.—and it was indeed the case, that they had not been all paid—the Articles had been obtained upon his private Credit, and, of course, the Accounts were without receipts upon them for payment. That, after the establishment of the present Government, your Memorialist did present his Accounts for Settlement at the Treasury, where the same Objection was taken, and he was, in order to obtain receipts so as to form Vouchers conformably to the Rules there adopted, obliged to give Bonds to the Individuals. That a farther Objection has been made, to wit, that several of the Charges, tho' unexceptionable in themselves, and necessarily incident to the Duties your Memorialist had to perform, are not authorized by any existing Law, which still prevents a Settlement, to the great Injury of the Creditors, and to himself; for he is thereby exposed to the danger of Suits at Law for Debts contracted for the public, and he has reason to believe that such Suits will soon be instituted against him. Your Memorialist therefore prays that the Officers of the Treasury may be empowered equitably to adjust his Accounts and pay whatever Ballance may be found to be due to him.” A' Sº CLAIR  Legis: 2" Sess: 2" Cong: Memorial of Arthur Sº Clair stating the performance of sundry services prescribed him by Congress he contracted debts which exceed the sums placed in his hands and praying that the officers of the Treasury may be empowered equitably to adjust his accounts.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO BEVERLEY RANDOLPH  PHILADELPHIA Feb. 18. 1793. DEAR SIR A great assembly of the Northern & Western Indians is to be held at Sandusky in the approaching spring, to be met by three Commissioners from the general government to treat of peace. it is highly important that some person from the Southward, possessing the public confidence, should be in the commission: and a person too who has firmness enough to form opinions for himself. though I know that your health was sometimes in default, yet I have ventured to propose you to the President who joined at once in the wish that you would undertake it, and I expect he writes to you by this post. it will be the greatest collection of Indians (about 3000) which has ever taken place, and from very distant & various parts. the route thither will be through N. York, the Hudson, the Mohawk, L. Ontario, Niagara, and L. Erie, and you could return by Fort Pitt. the season the finest of the year, & I presume every accomodation will be provided which the nature of the service admits. I am not able to say what the allowance will be, but I believe it has usually been 6. or 8. Doll. a day exclusive of expenses.” but this is guess-work in me.— I hope you will resolve to undertake it, as I conceive the public interest intimately concerned in the conducting of this treaty, and on that consideration I am confident you will sacrifice any private disinclination to it. be pleased to present my best respects to mº Randolph & to be assured of the esteem with which I am Dear Sir, your friend & ser’” TH: JEFFERSON BEVERLEY RANDOLPH esq. 
SENATOR BENJAMIN HAWKINS TO THE PRESIDENT , SENATE CHAMBER 20 feby 1793 There being a probality that an accommodation of our differences with the Northwestern Indians will be effected by treaty in the course of the expected negotiations with them: Or their enmity placed in so strong a point of view, as to endure a general acquiescance in the measures, which must of necessity be persued, by the government, to compell them to embrace such equitable terms, as the United States are willing to offer them. I cannot resist expressing to you an idea which forcibly opperates on my judgement as very desirable on the present occasion. It is well known that Mr Steel” is one of the warmest and most decided opponents to many of the measures heretofore adopted, and if he should by the Executive be enabled to have any agency in the treaty I am of opinion it would have the effect contemplated. He will not be a member of the ensuing Congress.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO P. BILLET  PHILADELPHIA, February 21*1793. MR. P. BILLET. SIR, A petition signed by a number of persons at Post Vincennes,” of whom you are first named, has been presented to the President of the United States, complaining 1" of duties imposed on all merchandize which raise them to exorbitant prices with you; and 2. That you are not permitted to sell or trade in any thing but on paying immense sums. The President has had this petition under consideration, and I am charged by him to observe that if by the duties complained of, you mean those imposed by the Spanish Government on supplies through the Missisippi, these are not subject to alteration by this Government. Relief from this, must depend on the result of negociations with Spain on behalf of our western Citizens for the free navigation of the Missisippi: but if by these duties is meant the impost paid on foreign importations on their entrance into our Atlantic ports, this depends on the Legislature of the United States, who would probably see great doubt and difficulty in taking off the imposts from those particular articles of importation which are sent forward to your settlement. As to the second complaint, it is supposed to have in view the regulations established by the Legislature for the Indian trade.” Some regulations were found necessary; those established were the result of the best information which could be obtained but might still be revised by the Legislature if it can be shewn that hardship and injustice result from any particular part of them: But such proofs should be brought forward, and well articulated. In the mean time these regulations do not prohibit the disposal of any thing which is of the produce of your farms, the President will at all times feel peculiar happiness in contributing to relieve your settlement from any well founded grievances. After desiring you to communicate this to your fellow petitioners, I subscribe myself, Sir, Your most humble servant TH: JEFFERSON. 
THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS TO THE PRESIDENT  [February 25, 1793) The President having required the attendance of the heads of the three departments and of the Attorney general at his house on Monday the 25" of Feb. 1793. the following questions were proposed and answers given. 1. The Governor of Canada having refused to let us obtain provisions from that province or to pass them along the water communication to the place of treaty with the Indians, and the Indians having refused to let them pass peaceably along what they call the bloody path, the Governor of Canada at the same time proposing to furnish the whole provisions necessary,” Ought the treaty to proceed? Answer unanimously, it ought to proceed. 2. Have the Executive or the Executive & Senate together authority to relinquish to the Indians the right of soil of any part of the lands" North of the Ohio, which has been validly obtained by former treaties?” - The Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary at War & Attorney general are of opinion that the Executive & Senate have such authority, JFeze woº T provided that no grants to individuals nor reservations to states be Take: thereby infringed. the Secretary of state is of opinion tpinion they have nº- Tsuch authority to relinquish. - Zºrºazz- —º. to make any such relinquishment to the “”T&. . Indians if essential to peace? 22/4, 77: e. -— The Secretaries of the Treasury & War & the Attorney general are of opinion it will be expedient to make such relinquishment, if essential to peace, provided it do not include any lands sold or reserved for special purposes (the reservations for trading places excepted).The Secretary of state is of opinion that the Executive and Senate have authority to stipulate with the Indians and that if essential to peace it . will be expedient to stipulate that we will not settle any lands between those already sold or reserved for special purposes, and the lines here-- Ttofore validly established with the Indians. TWhether the Senate shall be previously consulted on this point? 4.

J.

The order to the Attorney G*" has been presented to him, and he declared his readiness to render us every service in his power.” We have further to hope Sir, as we are Strangers in the country, and almost ruined by the confidence we have placed in some of its citizens; and more especially, as delay of proceedings in our behalf, till the next session of Congress may prove fatal to the infant colony, that you will be pleased to regard our case, and as far as may consist with the powers vested in you, countenance and expedite a relief from our Sufferings.

Territory to Gov" Sº Clair, which you sent to me yesterday, and is herewith returned, you shall be of opinion that my official interference is necessary on the subject of that letter, I must request that you will report to me wherein such interference may be necessary—as well as the Authority under which the President may exercise it.— But I confess to you that the long absence of the Governor as well as of some of the Judges from the territory,” appears to me, if not the cause of producing the irregularities complained of by the Secretary, to be a great means of encouraging a spirit of riot & disorder, by relaxing the energy of the Laws.”—This therefore is an additional reason for me to wish that the Governor may be pressed to repair to the Territory without delay—and unless he does, I shall be under the disagreeable necessity of issuing a peremptory order for that purpose.— I wish to be informed whether Judge Turner has set out for the Territory.— I think it would be best for you to consult with the Attorney Gen.' to determine whether transcripts of the treaties made with the Indians under the State Governt of N.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE RELATIVE TO INDIAN BOUNDARIES, [March 10, 1793) The Secretary of state, according to instructions received from the President of the U.S., Reports That, for the information of the Commissioners appointed to treat with the Western Indians, he has examined the several treaties entered into with them subsequent to the declaration of Independence, & relating to the lands between the Ohio & lakes, & also the extent of the grants, reservations, & appropriations of the same lands, made either by the United States, or by individual states, within the same period, & finds that the lands obtained by the said treaties & not so granted, reserved, or appropriated, are bounded by the following lines, to wit, Northwardly. by a line running, from the fork of the Tuscarora's branch of the Muskingum, at the crossing place above Fort Lawrence, Westwardly (towards the portage of the Big Miami) to the main branch of that river, then down the Miami to the fork of that river next below the old fort which was taken by the French in 1752. thence due West to the river de la Panse, & down that river to the Wabash: which lines were established with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippawas, & Ottawas by the treaty of fort M*Intosh, & with the Shawanese by that of the Great Miami. Westwardly, by the bounds of the Wabash Indians. Eastwardly. by the Million of acres appropriated to Military claimants by the resolution of Congress of Oct. 22. 1787.” and lying in the angle between the VII* range of townships counted Westwardly from the Pennsylvania boundary, and the X" range counted from the Ohio Northwardly along the said VII* which Million of acres may perhaps extend Westwardly so as to comprehend the XII* range of townships, counted in that direction from the Pennsylvania boundary: under which view the said XII" range may be assumed for the Eastern boundary of the territory now under consideration, from the said X* range to the Indian line. Southwardly. by the Northern boundary of the said X* range of townships to the Sioto river, and along the said river to what shall be the Northern limit of the appropriations for the Virginia line: (which two last lines are those of the lands granted to the Sioto company): thence along what shall be the northern limits of the said appropriations of the Virginia line to the Little Miami, and along the same to what shall be the Northern limit of one million of acres of land purchased by John C. Symmes: thence due West along the said Northern limit of the s” John C. Symmes, to the Great Miami, & down the same to it's mouth: then along the Ohio to General Clarke's lands, & round the said lands to the Ohio again, & down the same to the Wabash or the lands of the Indians inhabiting it. Which several lines are delineated on the copy of Hutchins's map accompanying this report; the dotted parts of the delineation denoting that they are conjectural. and it is further necessary to apprise the commissioners that, tho’ the points at which these several lines touch the Ohio are taken from actual surveys, yet the country included by the said lines, not being laid down from actual survey, their lengths & intersections with each other & with the watercourses, as appearing in the map, are not at all to relied on. No notice is here taken of the lands at the mouth of the Ohio appropriated for military bounties by the same resolution of Congress of Oct. 22. 1787. nor of the settlements of Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Post Vincennes &c.. because these can concern no Indians but those of the Illinois & Wabash, whose interests should be transacted with themselves separately, and not be permitted to be placed under the patronage of the Western Indians.” TH: JEFFERSON Mar. 10, 1793.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT , WAR DEPARTMENT March 12th 1793 SIR . The request made by the Indians of having some of “the friends” called Quakers to attend the treaty at Sandusky seems to Tdeserve consideration.” I presume that some of those Citizens would chearfully accompany the Commissioners, provided their expenses Twere borne, and perhaps a small compensation made for their time. It might also conduce considerably to the success of the treaty" were Mr John Heckewelder to accompany the Commissioners.” This amiable and intelligent Man is a teacher of the sect called Moravians, and for several Years resided with the Indians belonging to that sect of the Wyandot and Delaware Tribes, who inhabited the Waters of Muskingum—he well understanding their language—The influence he will have with the said Tribes may be expected to be very considerable. He accompanied General Putnam who speaks highly in praise of his virtues and knowledge of Indian customs—While employed on this business, independent of his expences he has been allowed two and an half dollars p day as a compensation for his services.

Induced by these motives, and desirous that time may be allowed for a full & deliberate consideration of the subject before the departure of the Commissioners, it is my desire that you will on the 25* day of this instant meet together at the War Office (where the documents are) with such papers as you may respectively be possess'd of & wº"I shall cause to be laid before y[ou] then & there, or at such other time or place as you may agree upon, decide on all the points which you shall conceive necessary for the information and instruction of the Commissioners—and having drawn them into form, to revise the same & have them ready in a finished state for my perusal and consideration when I return—together with a digest of such references as shall be adjudged necessary for the Commissioners to take with them.— And, as it has been suggested to me, that the Society of Quakers, are desirous of sending a deputation from their body to be present at the aforesaid treaty (which if done with pure motives, & a disposition accordant with those sentiments entertained by Governm' respecting boundary may be a mean of facilitating the good work of peace) you will consider how far, if they are approved characters, they ought to be recognized in the Instructions to the Commissioners—& how proper it may be for them to participate therein or to be made acquainted therewith.-"  Circular To the Secretary of State D* of the Treasury D° of War—& The Atty Gen' of the U.

DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 1* instant came to my hands yesterday.-I regret the indisposition of General Knox; but hope, as there is yet time for consideration of those matters I referred to the heads of the departments, no inconvenience will result from the delay occasioned thereby unless it sh" continue much longer.—At George Town I met M! Randolph;-& by a letter just recº from M* Lear, I am informed that General Lincoln was expected to be in Philadelphia about the middle of this Week. I am so much surprized, and mortified at the Conduct of Judge Turner, that if he should be in Philadelphia at the receipt of this letter, & not the least evidence of his proceeding to the N° Western Territory immediately It is my desire that you will, in my name express to him, Tas far as my powers will authorise you to do, that I can no longer sub-T mit to such abuses of public trust without instituting (if I have T powers to set it on foot) an enquiry into his conduct."—The same T with respect to the Governor of that territory—Such remissness in these Gentlemen not only reflects upon the common rules of propriety but must implicate me in the shamefulness of their conduct, in suf- Tfering it.— – ~ I hope the accº brought by the Capt" from Lisbon had no better foundation than that suggested in your letter; for I sh" be sorry to receive a confirmation of it.— It was prudent, however, to guard against an event which might have proved unfortunate in case of the Capture of the Pac' With esteem &* I am, G° WASHINGTON  To The Secº of State 5 April 1793. 
JOHN ROME TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL , PHILADELPHIE le 14 avril 1793 Monsieur Dans L'entretien que vous avés eu ce matin avec M* Putnam, au Sujët du contract passé entre la Comp" du Scioto et celle de L'Ohio, en faveur des habitants de Gallipolis, vous avés paru faire peu d'attention à une circonstance trés frappante, et Sur la quelle à la vérité Mº Putnam m'a paru glisser légérement.—Je vous a dit que lorsque la Comp" de L'Ohio au commencement de l'année derniere régler Ses comptes avec le Congrès, Le contract en question fut envoyé au trésorier de cette Comp", avec un Pouvoir général d'entirer le meilleur parti qu'il lui Seroit possible. M' Putnam a ajouté qu'il ignoroit entierem' quel avoit été le résultat de la negotiation du tresorier.—En admettant que M' Putnam Soit rééllement dans l'ignorance à cet égard, pourquoi vous avoit il dit quelque minutes auparavant que la Comp" de L'Ohio n’avoit rien recu pour ce contract, puisqu'il est au contraire trés probable que le trésorier a pu recevoir depuis ce tems, de quelque uns des membres Solvables de la C* du Scioto, leur proportion du payement: et qu'il avoit même des moyens de Se faire payer par Duer et par Flint, qui possedoient chacun un certain nombre d'actions dans la Comp" de l'ohio–cette matiere me Semble importante a eclaircir, et je crois que Mº Putnam pourroit à cet égard vous donner de meilleurs renseignemens que personne, s'il vouloit. J’ai L'honneur d'etre avec Respect Monsieur Votre tres Humble et tres ob" Serviteur ROME [Addressed] The Attorney G* of the United States Vine Street Philadelphia  L. 1* Sess: 3" Con. Letter to the Attorney General U.S. from Mr Rome. April 14* 1793. - [Translation] PHILADELPHIA, April 14, 1793. MY DEAR SIR: In the conversation which you had this morning with Mr. Putnam, regarding the contract concluded between the Scioto Company and the Ohio Company, in favor of the inhabitants of Gallipolis, you seemed to pay little attention to a very striking circumstance which Mr. Putnam, it seemed to me, really passed over lightly. I told you that when the Ohio Company settled its accounts with Congress at the beginning of last year, the contract in question was sent to the treasurer of that company with a general authorization to draw from it the greatest possible advantage. Mr. Putnam added that he had no information whatever as to what had been the result of the treasurer's negotiation. If we admit that Mr. Putnam really has no information on this point, why did he tell you a few minutes before that the Ohio Company had not received anything for that contract, since it is, on the contrary, very probable that the treasurer may have received since that time from some of the solvent members of the Scioto Company, their proportion of the payment; and that he even had the means of obtaining payment from Duer and from Flint, each one of whom owned a certain number of shares in the Ohio Company—it seems to me important to clear up this matter, and I believe that Mr. Putnam could, if he wished, give you better information on this subject than any one else. I have the honor to be, Sir, your very respectful, humble, and obedient servant. ROME
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO JUDGE TURNER  PHILADELPHIA, April 17* 1793. THE HON” JUDGE TURNER— SIR, The inconveniences which have resulted to the Territory of the United States, northwest of the Ohio, from the absence of the legislative and judiciary bodies, and the length of time you have in particular been absent have rendered it necessary, in the opinion of the President, that some legal enquiry into the causes of it should be instituted: and I have it in charge from him to inform you, that the Attorney General of the United States is instructed to consider and to do what may be proper on the occasion.” I have the honor to be with great esteem & respect, Sir, &c.

PROCLAMATION OF GENERAL ANTHONY WAYNE [MHS: Pickering Papers: C*] A PROCLAMATION [April 22, 1793) By his Excellency ANTHONY WAYNE, Esquire, Major General and Commander in Chief of the Legion of the United States of America. Whereas the President of the United States of America did nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, has appointed three commissioners to hold a treaty with the hostile Indians at the Lower Sandusky on or about the first day of June next, ensuing, to endeavour to effect a permanent peace with those Indians: And whereas it would be highly improper, that any hostile attempts should be made against any of the Indian towns or settlements, whilst the aforesaid treaty is pending. I am therefore ordered by the President, and I do, hereby, in his name, most solemnly forbid and restrain any attempts being made against any of the Indian towns or settlements until the result of the treaty is known. Given under my hand and seal at Head-Quarters, Legionville, this 22d day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety three, and in the seventeenth year of the Independence of the United States.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR , WAR DEPARTMENT April 24, 1793– SIR, The President of the United States has particularly directed me to inform you that the proposed treaty with the hostile Indians North of the Ohio will be held at lower Sandusky about the first of June next—That during the continuance of the Treaty it is of the highest importance to the success thereof, as well as to the safety of the Commissioners that all hostile incursions of the white Inhabitants into or near to the Indian Country North of the Ohio should be absolutely prohibited, until after the Treaty be closed— The Commanding General of the Troops has been directed to issue a proclamation to this effect; and the President requests that you would be pleased to take such measures in the premisses with your frontier Citizens as shall in your judgment be most effectual to prevent a measure which might be attended with highly pernicious consequences” I am Sir Your humble servant— H KNOX Secy of War GOVERNOR Sº CLAIR  Gen' Knox 24" April 1793 to Col. Winthrop Sargent No. 14. 
THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA  WAR DEPARTMENT April 24, 1793. SIR I have the honor to receive your letter of the 12" ins' and to Submit it to the President of the United States. While it is acknowledged that the frontier Citizens ought to be effectually protected against actual dangers it is to be observed that it is difficult and perhaps impracticable to guard against all possible dangers of stragling Indians—The measure therefore adopted on the part of the Executive of directing General Wood to the scene of apprehended danger is highly judicious in order to judge of the real state of things. It has been hoped that the proposed treaty with the Indians North of the Ohio would have restrained entirely their depredations until the result should have been known. And although this will probably be the case as it may respect any invasion by considerable bodies of Indians, yet the principles of Government among the savage tribes are too little understood and their manner of living too dispersed to expect that every individual Indian will obey what is understood to have been the injunction of their Councils forbidding any Warriors from acting on our frontiers. The President of the United States has particularly directed me to inform your Excellency that the proposed Treaty will be held at lower Sandusky to commence about the first of June next. That during the continuance of the Treaty it is of the highest importance to the success thereof, as well as to the safety of the Commissioners that all hostile incursions of the White Inhabitants into or near to the Indian Country North of the Ohio should be absolutely prohibited until after the Treaty be closed " The Commanding General of the Troops has been directed to issue a proclamation to this effect, and the President requests that you would be pleased to take such measures in the premises with your frontier Citizens as shall in your judgment be most effectual to prevent a measure which might be attended with highly pernicious consequences— I have the honor to be with great esteem Your Excellencys humble Servant H KNOX 
HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR LEE THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE INDIAN COMMISSIONERS, WAR DEPARTMENT April 29th 1793– GENTLEMEN In case that you should unfortunately fail in effecting a treaty with the hostile Indians, you will please to write a letter of the following form, (transmitting by different conveyances at least six Copies signed by all of you) to Major General Wayne who will be at Fort Washington on the Ohio– “We were at Sandusky [blank] days—Although we did not effect a peace, yet we hope that good may hereafter arise from the mission. The tranquillity of the Country North West of the Ohio during the continuance of the Treaty evinced your Care of our safety, and we could not leave this quarter without returning you our unfeigned thanks.” Instead of the form of the Treaty mentioned in your general instructions, the extract of a Letter herein enclosed from the Attorney General, will show you his opinion generally on the subject of the form which may be proper to be observed " I am Gentlemen with great respect Your humble servant H KNOX - Secy of War BENJAMIN LINCOLN BEVERLY RANDOLPH & TIMOTHY PICKERING Esq."

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT , GREENSBURGH June 8th 1793 SIR You will probably be surprised to see a Letter from me of this date from this place The Delay I have met with in this Country has distressed me extremly, but it has been unavoidable; for I have been at the very point of Death: and now I am so far recovered only as to be barely able to ride but still too weak to walk more than a few yards at a time: nevertheless, I am on my way to Pittsburgh to avail myself of the first Opportunity to descend the River where indeed I ought to have been long ago. My Duty requires me to account for not being there which will I hope be my Excuse for obtruding myself—One more such Attack will probably stop the Scene forever.

PROCLAMATION OF GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  CINCINNATI County OF HAMILTON Aug' 9" 1793 SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 19* of April.” together with the ten Volumes of the Acts passed at the 2° Session of the second Congress, which shall be distributed in such manner as to render an accouaintance with them as general as possible. In my progress to this Place Having halted at Marietta to see the Magistrates and enquire a little into the State of that Settlement, and an Opportunity to Pittsburgh presenting at the Moment, on the 25 of July " I issued a Proclamation for the meeting of the Legislature of the Territory on the first of September at this Place, and took the Liberty to enclose a Copy of it to you, with a request that you would cause copies to be sent to the Judges Symmes and Turner, neither of whom I knew where to find, but it was probable their residence might be known to you—I am very sensible Sir, this was a Liberty that demands an apology, and I was sensible of the impropriety at the time—and nothing would have induced me to take it but the uncertainty as to the places where they were to be found, and the expence that would have attended the sending an Express, if one could have been obtained, which would have been difficult.—Be assured Sir, unless it should be a very pressing Case indeed I shall not take it agaln. I have the pleasure to inform you that the difficulties which existed with respect to the Court of Common Pleas for this County are accommodated in a manner that gives Satisfaction, and any irregularities that have happened in their proceedings will, I hope be helped by the Legislature at the same time the Dignity of the Government has not been committed, nor the just and necessary prerogative of the Governor weakened. the particulars have been communicated to the Attorney General" and I have at the same time made some Observations upon some of the Laws passed here at the last Session of the Legislature, and may possibly make some more, but I realy do not know whether it is to him or to you that the Laws of this Territory are referred,” for consideration tho it should seem of course that they be referred to him.—this may be considered as a work of supererogation in me—but Sir the circumstances of different parts of this Territory are extremely dissimilar, and it is very difficult to adopt Law general Laws to those variant Circumstances, and the operation of the Laws falling more immediately within the observation of the Governor, than of any Person at the Seat of Government, tho infinitely better qualified to judge of them in the abstract, I have presumed that it would not be deemed an intrusion and should it be to you they are referred, and you will permit me any Observations which I may think necessary, shall be addressed to you. With Sentiments of the greatest Esteem and respect I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient and most humble Servant.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , CINCINNATI, County OF HAMILTON August 9” 1793. SIR, I have observed with pleasure the Measures you are pursuing, to make it more apparently the interest of the People in the western Counties of Pennsylvania to comply with the Excise Laws—it was their real interest before. The Opposition began with the Distillers who were in a combination against the People, but it has been fostered since by others, and for very bad purposes. To assist you the little that may be in my power, I will, if possible, procure a Law at the next Session of the Legislature, which is called for the first of September, forbidding the importation of all ardent Spirits into the Territory the Duties upon which have not been either paid or secured,” and if I should fail in it, Congress I suppose will not leave this Country open as a receptacle for the manufacture of a part of their People, in a State little short of actual Rebellion— and it [is] this Country that is their principal Market—and I mention it to you now, that you may think of it and put it in train if it meets your approbation. Indeed, should I succeed, I would be glad even to see the Law disapproved, and another enacted by Congress to the same purpose, for it is already time that the People of this Country should be put in Mind that they are not yet a part of the Union, but dependent upon it.” I have heard that we are threatened with a War with Spain—I hope  in God we shall not be involved with any of the European Powers, for at present a War with one seems to be nearly allied with a War with several others. But if the Business was settled on that continent, and the present confederacy disolved, which a Campaign, that is not decidedly successful against France, will I think certainly dissolve, and this cursed Indian War at an end, of which I but little prospect at present—to the western People it would be the most desirable thing possible.—but I fear instead of Peace with them the Season for offensive Operation will be wasted in fruitless negociation, and a more Extensive and formidable confederacy of the Savages than ever was known will be the Result. I sincerely hope and pray that I may be mistaken. I have a Letter from the Kaskaskias of the 2" of June "" which speaks of the Spaniards arming themselves on the upper parts of the Missisippi, and I have given an extract to the Secretary of War, which will I suppose be communicated to the President if he thinks it of consequence enough, and of course to you The Writer is a respectable and intelligent Man, and would not give me information he did not himself believe.—When he resided at Detroit, I received much useful Intelligence thro' him. In compassion to a poor Devil banished to another Planet, but like the Soul of some departed Sinner as they left us, still hovering about that he had left, tell me what is doing in Yours, if you can snatch a Moment from the weighty Cares of your Office. Whether you do or not I shall always find myself deeply interested in your Fame and Fortune. I pray you to make my best Respects to M* Hamilton, and with the best wishes I can possibly form, truly and affectionately I Am Dear Sir Your most obedient servant A*S* CLAIR ALEXANDER HAMILTON Esquire The Indians, the night before last, took off fourteen of the Contractors Horses within four Miles of this Place.

I do not know that you can ever have anything to do in the line of Finance. every thing else falls into the department of State, to the head of which it should be addressed—to him the general report, given every Six Months, is referred, and if there are matters in it proper for the other departments he reports them to the President who sends the extracts to the proper department.—whether in or out of Office, I shall ever be happy to render you any service I can, being with sincere respect Dear Sir, &" TH: JEFFERSON 
A PROCLAMATION BY GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  [December 8, 1793) By Arthur Sº Clair Governor of the Territory of the united States northwest of the River Ohio A PROCLAMATION United States are allied to France, yet they are not Parties to this War, but are at Peace with all the other Powers, and in particular with Spain, from which political situation results, by the Law of Nations, the Duty a strict neutrality, and a Conduct perfectly equal and impartial towards all the belligerent Powers, the observation of which neutrality has been enjoined upon the Citizens of the united states by the President in his Proclamation bearing date the 22" day of April 1793; And it having been communicated to me thro the Secretary of War that Representations have been made to the President by the Representatives of Spain of the designs of certain Frenchmen by the Names of la Chaise,” Charles Delpeau, Mathurin and Signoux to excite and engage as many as they could of our Citizens or others to undertake an Expedition against the spanish settlements within our Neighbourhood I have thought fit to issue this Proclamation enjoining all the Inhabitants of the Territory of the united States north west of the River Ohio to observe a strict neutrality towards Spain; and to abstain from every Act of hostility against the Subjects and Settlements of that crown, and strictly forbidding all and every of the said Inhabitants to join themselves to the said la Chaise, Charles Depeau, Mathurin and Signoux or either of them in any attempt they may meditate or undertake against the spanish settlements on the Missisippi, or to aid and abett them in the same in any manner whatsoever: And all Persons who shall offend in the Premises may depend upon being prosecuted and punished with the utmost rigor of the Law: And I do hereby require and command all Officers civil and military to use their utmost endeavours to prevent the said la Chaise &c" or either of them from making any levies of Men or other preparation for their intended Expedition within the Territory and to imprison them should they have the audacity to attempt it, and to restrain all and every of the Inhabitants from joining themselves to them or either of them. In testimony whereof I have caused the Seal of the Territory to be affixed to these Presents, and have signed the same with my Hand.

J. ROME TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, 26th December 1793 SIR Having been called out of the city of Philadelphia by some private business, which absolutely required my presence, and my best exertions, I think it my duty to recommend to your kindness and vigilance the concerns of the French Settlers of Gallipolis—you know better than myself the various incidents of that unfortunate affair, and how little we must depend on the good will, or on the abilities of the individuals who engaged in it, to comply with the terms of their bargain.-The inhabitants of Gallipolis are by no means able to prosecute in law the Authors of their misery: admitting then that the prosecution should be carried on in the name of The United States; who knows better than you the length of time requisite to bring such a prosecution to an issue. in either case I consider the ruin of the Settlement as equally unavoidable. the circumstances of the Settlers are such that the least uncertainty or delay must quite wear out their constancy almost exhausted by the many disapointments and difficulties they had to struggle with, for the space of three years. Should The United States think it of some importance, to increase the population and to strengthen the defence of this part of their frontiers, they must give some encouragement to a Settlement which in the present circumstances, may reasonably be considered as the basis of a very considerable foreign population. the only proper encouragement in my opinion, would be a provisional grant of fifty thousand acres of Land, as they were granted last year by the house of representatives; in consideration of which grant, the Settlers would abandon to the United States all their rights and pretensions both on the ohio and Scioto companies. I mention only the Settlers of Gallipolis, because I have no authority to compromise for the rest of the French purchasers, and because their pretensions are considerably higher, the total purchase being supposed to amount to four hundred thousand acres. Since our last interview Sir I have seen M* Elsworth and Brown. both of them agreed to insist on your report being presented to the Senate as soon as possible. the succes of our demand, they said, depended in a great measure on the early period of the presentation. I could not procure here a print of the engraved map which had been delivered to each purchaser by the agents of the Comp" in Paris. but be assured the boundaries of the Ohio and Scioto Comp" on that map, were fixed by a line running South and North from the mouth of the big Kanhawa River. I dare say there are at least a hundred copies of it in the hands of the Settlers at Gallipolis. Mº Sergeant who's still in Philadelphia would probably procure it: he lodges in Strawberry alley N. 28. I am absolutely ignorant of the time at which my private concerns will admit of my going back to Philadelphia: your report to the Senate is quite independent of my presence there. and beside I am writing to Mº Brown by this opportunity. I would consider it Sir as a particular favour to receive a few lines from you marking the time at which you will make your report 7” as well as the General Purport of it. The Person who has been intrusted with this letter, has been directed to send from time to time to your house to know if you have any message for me. my business calling me from place to place I thought that way more expedient than the post to receive safely what you will think proper to Direct 7° I have the Honour to be with respect Sir your most ob" Humb.

SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE PRESIDENT, PHILADELPHIA Decº 30° 1793 SIR Conscious as I am that the Duties of a public Servant should precede his every other Consideration, and extreme anxious at all times to observe such Propriety of Conduct as may meet the full Approbation of the sovereign Authority of the United States, I feel it incumbent upon me to explain the Causes of my Absence from the northwestern Territory at this Time. In the August of 1790 * I had the honour of representing to you that my Expenses as Secretary of said Territory far exceeded the Salary affixed to that Office, and in the December following by permission of Governor Sº Clair (having made provision for the Discharge of my public Duties) was attendant upon Congress in an Essay for Compensation: A memorial was presented to the Senate and house of representatives and refered to the Secretary of the Treasury"-but before the same could be reported upon (Governour Sº Clair arriving in this City) your pleasure for my immediate return to his Government was signified to me— To the present moment the Secretary of the Treasury has been so much and so importantly engaged that no attention could be bestowed to my memorial,” and in far the greatest part of the intervening Time I have been involved in all the Duties and Expenses of both Governor and Secretary of the western Territory rendered, in a pecuniary point of View, in the last year peculiarly distressing from the failure of some private resources—And from which Consideration I was induced to solicit Leave of Absence from Duty for a few months through General Knox, in whose Sense of propriety it being inadmissible the request was never made, and I remained in the Territory to the absolute Sacrifice of more than the amount of my whole pay as Secretary thereof until the Governours return and permission liberated me (after providing for the Secretary's Duties) in the late Autumn, to urge my petition to the general Government and adjust some private Concerns 77— This representation I have conceived it my Duty to make to you Sir, and I flatter myself it will apologize for my being in Philadelphia with Sentiments of the highest respect I have the honour to be Sir your most obedient and humble Servant WINTHROP SARGENT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  From Winthrop Sargent 30 Dec 1793. 
OBSERVATIONS ON THE PETITION OF THE FRENCH INHABITANTS OF GALLIPOLIS  [1793 c.] The petition of the French inhabitants of Gallipolis, consists of two distincts and Separate objects. and they beg leave to Submitt to the H* Comittee call'd to make this report on that petition, few observations which may in some measure facilitate their decisions on the Subject. One of the objects of the petition of the sº inhabitants is to ask a portion of lands equal to the purchase they made in france in the year 1790 from the Scioto Comp' the motives on which their demand is grounded, are the deception they experienced from the agents of that company, the considerable expences they have been Subject to, in coming and bringing over a great number of workmen—the increase of population brought into a desert country exposed to the excursions of the indians, whom they may oppose even in their now distressed Situation with hundred and fifty fighting men. the calamities of an indian war, their courage and constancy in struggling against them, the title they have got to the humanity and particular attention of Government, by being foreigners and frenchmen, impos'd upon, and ruin’d by american Speculators. all those considerations together, induce them to believe that Congress will and they dare Say must treat them in a generous manner: and the s” inhabitants hope and expect Congress will add to the Small portion of land they have right to by their purchase in france, a generous grant, which will enable them in future times, to make up for their pass'd distresses.—they dare Say it would be a good policy to do it. is there any private person owner of two millions of acres of unsettled land, who would refuse two hundred and fifty individuals, a small comparative portion of hundred thousand acres of that land—to make the rest of it more valuable, the agents of the Spanish Government have made to the french inhabitants of Gallipolis, proposals of a higher nature, they never listened to, not withstanding their very distress'd Situation, on account of the confidence they allways put in the liberality and generous dispositions of Congress towards them.—another consideration of some weight, is that there is at least a third part of the inhabitants of Gallipolis who come to this country bound as workmen, who have not any landed property and by no means able to get any The Second object of the s” petition, and which Seems at the first view present the greatest difficulties, is the demand of the s” inhabitants of Keeping the lands on which they are now Settled. a certain fact is that it is out of the power of the greatest part of them, to move from the lands they have cleared and the houses they have build, which are now their only ressource: On the other hand it is evident, and the inhabitants of Gallipolis do not want to be told, that it is out of the power of the Legislature to dispossess any private person or any body of men of their lawfull property. it is generally said and indeed we believe the Ohio Company owns the Same lands on which we are now Settled. but has not the ohio company means Sufficient to compensate for those lands? did not Congress make a grant to that comp" of hundred thousand acres of land to be distributed among the Settlers on their purchase? have not the french Settlers at Gallipolis right to their proportional share thereof' did the legislature fix a particular spot of land for the purpose? and Supposing it has been done, could not the legislature in favour of the s” petitioners undo that particular clause of the act, and cover with thirty or fourty thousand acres of that land the improvements and purchase of the inhabitants of Gallipolis—the petitioners Submit their observations to the Superior Knowledge of the committee, convinced as they are of their liberal dispositions in behalf of their just claim.

D'aprés ces pouvoirs, Barlow vendit en France á une comp° formée Sous le nom de la comp° du Scioto, par un acte passe devant Rameau not° â paris le 3 aout 1789. cette comp° nomma pour Ses agents W" Playfair et chaiss de Soissons, qui conjointement avec Barlow, vendirent en detail des portions du terrein ci dessus, â un grand nombre de particuliers francais â la fin de l'année 1789 et au commencement de 1790. dans le courant de cette derniere année, Barlow vendit á une autre comp° francaise les parties de ce terrein qui n'avoiens pas été vendues par la premiere, et cette Seconde comp° vendit Sur le champ diverses parties de ce terrein â plusieurs particuliers. Dans la description du terrein qui avoit été communiquée aux divers achetteurs francais, Le terrein de la comp° du Scioto était censé S'étendre depuis cette riviere le long de l'ohio jusqu'á L'embouchure du grand Kanhawa-á leur arrivée en Amérique les francais furent reçus par W" Duer en Qualité de Sur Intendant de la comp° du Scioto. il traita avec eux en cette qualité, et en attendant que les préparatifs et les arpentages nécéssaires pour leur distribuer les terreins qu'ils avoient achettées pussent etre faits, il donna á chacun d'eux deux lots de ville et un lot de quatre acres, Sur le terrein de Gallipolis-et ce Sont lá toutes les terres dont ils ont en la jouissance depuis leur arrivée en amérique. Je dis la jouissance parce que quoique ce terrein fut Censé etre compris dans Le droit de préemption de la comp° du Scioto, il appartenoit en effect â cette de l'ohio, avec la quelle la premiere avait traité au moment de l'arrivée des francais-mais les conditions du traité n'ayant pas été remplies par la premiere La Seconde réclame ses droits. Les défrichements de Gallipolis ne S'etendent encore qu'a quatre au cinq cents acres de terre: et je Suis fondé â croire que cinq au Six mille acres autour de cet établissement, pourroient Satisfaire les habitants qui y sont fixés á présent, Sans Barrer les droits qu'ils ont sur le terrein qu'ils ont achetté en france de la comp° du Scioto. associates of the associates of the Ohio company Scioto company M° Cuttler Wm Duer WintP Sergent M° Cuttler Ruf. putnam Wintº Sergent green - Guilman Ruf putnam tupper Cregey Meggs constable  L. 1" Sess: 3º Con: M" Rome's Stateº [Translation] [1793 c.] On the 23d and the 27th of July, 1787, Congress passed two resolutions, giving to Manassé Cuttler and Winthrop Sergent and their associates the right of preemption of the land comprised between the seventh range of townships, the Ohio River, and the Scioto River and certain boundaries fixed toward the north. In consequence of these two resolutions, Manassé Cutler and Winthrop Sergent entered on the 27th of October of the same year into negotiations with the counsel of the Treasury of the United States in order to acquire a part of this land, in the name of the Ohio Company— and as to the other part of the land, which was subject to the right of preemption, they entered into negotiations on the same day with the counsel of the treasury for their own account. On the 29th of the same month of October, 1787, Cuttler and Sergent and their associates, on the one side, and Wm. Duer and his associates on the other side, concluded an association contract, received by Jean Wilkes, notary public of New York. By this contract, Cuttler and Sergent grant and convey to Duer their rights and claims, in equal parts, to the above-mentioned land, and establish an equal and inseparable right in the dispositions which might be made of this land both in Europe and America. They authorize Wm. Duer to mortgage or sell the said land in Holland or in such other part of Europe as he may consider proper and to send an agent to Europe for this purpose to carry on the said negotiation in accordance with the instructions that he would receive from him, it being well understood, however, that Wm. Duer would communicate from time to time, or when he might be requested to do so by Cuttler and Sergent, the progress of the negotiation. X Duer obligates himself to advance the sum of one hundred thousand dollars—X and to that extent it is stipulated that the benefit of the preference for this land depends on the exact payment on the part of the Ohio Company of half of the purchase price of the land for which it has contracted X. Pursuant to this contract, Duer sent Joel Barlow to France in the capacity of agent, giving him authority in the name of the Scioto Company to sell or mortgage for any sum which he might deem proper, such part or parts of the said land as he might deem proper, and obligating himself in the name of his company, and under the powers given him, to ratify all the contracts which the said Barlow might conclude with any entity or private individual whatsoever. In the exercise of these powers, Barlow made a sale in France to a company organized under the name of the Scioto Company, by a contract concluded in the presence of Rameau, a notary at Paris, on the 3d of August, 1789. That company appointed as its agents Wm. Playfair and Chaiss(?) de Soissons who, conjointly with Barlow, sold in separate lots portions of the above-mentioned land to a great number of French private individuals at the end of the year 1789 and at the beginning of 1790. During the latter year, Barlow sold to another French company the portions of this land which had not been sold by the former, and the latter company sold on the spot various portions of this land to several private individuals. In the description of the land which had been communicated to various French purchasers, the land of the Scioto Company was considered as extending from the river of that name along the Ohio to the mouth of the Great Kanawha. On their arrival in America, the French were received by W. Duer in the capacity of controller of the Scioto Company. He treated with them in that capacity, and pending the time when the preparations and surveys necessary for distribution among them of the land which they had purchased could be made, he gave to each of them two city lots and one lot of four acres on the Gallipolis land—and that is all the land of which they have had the enjoyment since their arrival in America. I say the enjoyment because, although that land was supposed to be included in the right of preemption of the Scioto Company, it actually belonged to the Ohio Company, with which the former had treated at the time of the arrival of the French—but the conditions of the treaty not having been fulfilled by the former, the latter claimed its rights. The Gallipolis land cleared does not as yet include more than four or five hundred acres, and I have reason to believe that five or six thousand acres around that settlement, might satisfy the inhabitants established there at present, without annulling the rights which they have to the land which they have purchased in France from the Scioto Company. 
STATEMENT OF ELIAS BOUDINOT: THE INHABITANTS OF GALLIPOLIS  [1793 c.] The Facts that I have referred to, with regard to the Galliopolis Tract of Land are. When the Scioto Company discovered the rise of Certificates whereby the profit of carrying their purchase into Execution became doubtfull, they agreed with the Ohio Company for 100,000 Acres of Land, Off the West End of their Tract, on which they might seat the French People, with whom they had Contracted for a smaller Quantity, making them beleive that was the Land sold to them— I have seen the Agreement, between the Agents for the Ohio Company & the Agents for the Scioto Company, I think Mess. Duer, Craige & Fowler.—I am greatly mistaken, if in this Agreement there were not express words of Conveyance by which all the right of the Ohio Company passed to the Grantees—I well remember that I gave my Opinion that there could remain no doubt, considering the Claim of the Ohio Company, but as an Equitable Right, they having no Deed—On this principle it was that I was Careful that our late law, authorizing the Presid to patent the Lands, should be to the Company & their associates & assigns or something to this purpose The Agents for the Scioto Co. were then, I conceive, vested with the Equitable Right to these Lands, when they settled the French People at Galliopolis— Since the last Session, by some agreement between the Agents for the Ohio Co. & M" Duer & they have destroyed the Agreement as I am informed, and now the Ohio Co. Claims the Land, as having never been sold, alledging that the Sciota Co. never paid for it—The Argument that the Settlers on the Ohio Co.'s Tract were a Barrier agº the Indians was frequently made use of to urge Congress to give that Co. the 100000 Acres of Land, to be divided among Settlers— ELIAS BOUDINOT  L. 1" Sess: 3" Con: Concerning Galliopolis people

SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, PHILADELPHIA Jamy 2" 1794 SIR In Consequence of your Queries relative to the Absence of Govenour Sº Clair from the Territory northwest of the Ohio—causes thereof &c." I have made a reference to the Record of Proceedings of the Executive Department of that Government (now in the Office of the Secretary of State) and it appears that his first Absence was from the 24" of January 1789 to the 24" of December of the same year—this took place immediately after the Treaty of Fort Harmar, and probably to report the same to the general Government. Upon the 11" of June 1790," having formally relinquished to me his powers and Duties, He again left the Territory to attend the general Government—at this time the Disposition of the Savages was hostile and the Expedition which afterwards took place under General Harmar was meditated; He was absent to the 16" of September of the same year, And upon the succeeding December (about the 20*) and soon after the Event of the said Expedition He again visited the general Government and upon the 29" of April 1791 returned to the Territory in Command of the Army— Upon the 1* of may his military Duties called him to Kentuckey and the Government was with the Secretary to the 8" of June following— From the 18" to the 29" of August, and from the 31" of August to the 12* of September the Governour again in Kentuckey. Upon the 8" of December in the same year, and very soon after the Defeat of the Army under his Command He quitted the Government and was absent to the 2" of August 1793.”—probably in attending to the Investigation, directed, of the Causes of Failure of his Expedition— Antecedent to this Sir, and to the Law authorising the Secretary of the western Territory to discharge the Duties of the Governour, bearing Date August 7" 1789,” I was involved in some Expenses not incident to my Office, from the Circumstance of preceeding Him to the western Country and continuing resident from April 1788 to July, in his Absence. It is proper I should observe Sir that my Duties as Scribe for indian Business which necessarily engaged very much attention to the 11” of June 1790 were then considerably lessened by the Obstacles to a friendly Intercourse with the Indians—And that for the furnishing Copies of the Territorial Laws to the several Counties (which was one of the Objects of my petition to Congress) a provision has been made by our Legislature since June 1791 *— with great Respect I have the honour to be Sir your obedº Humble Servant WINTHROP SARGENT HONBLE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  Letter to the Secretary of the Treasury Jan 2° 1794 No 5 
SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  PHILADELPHIA 3° of Jamy 1794 The Secretary of the Territory of the United States North west of the river Ohio begs leave to represent to the Honourable the Secretary of State that considerable inconveniences accrue to the inhabitants of Vincennes upon the Oubache river by a delay of the Patents for the Donation lands to the ancient settlers thereof.” Some doubts in the mind of the Governour whether those Patents are to be issued by the general government or himself, is the cause of this delay—And the opinion of the Secretary of State is requested thereupon.*— He is also respectfully requested to permit the printing of the Laws passed in the Northwest Territory at the Session of the Legislature of 1792 to be effected as early as may be convenient, it being very essential to the welfare of the said Territory. THE HONOURABLE SECRETARY OF STATE. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT , PHILADELPHIA January 4, 1794. SIR I have examined the journal of the proceedings of the executive in the territory North West of the Ohio. It is very little more, than a history of bickerings and discontents, which do not require the attention of the President. I shall therefore forbear to send it to you, unless you should call for it. The laws of that territory are now under transcription, that they may be forwarded to Congress. It was for some time doubted, whether they were to be laid before that body, without a special order for that purpose. But the doubt is now removed, by a conversation with Colº Sargent. I have the honor, sir, to be with the highest respect yº mo. ob. ser" - EDM: RANDOLPH. THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.  From The Secy of State 4 Jan: 1794. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT  [January 21, 1794) The Secretary of State has the honor of informing the President, that he has caused two copies to be made of the laws of the north western territory, and now incloses them. It was long doubted, whether it was the duty of the Executive to lay them before congress. But upon a closer examination of the ordinance, the propriety of the step flows from the right, reserved to congress, to disapprove these laws. For how are Congress to get official possession of them, but by an official communication from the Executive files, among which they are lodged? The form of a message is not sent; because it is apprehended, that the President may choose to connect these laws with some other information, and one message may cover both.* January 21* 1794. 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: SARGENT'S MEMORIAL  [January 31, 1794) The Secretary of the Treasury to whom was referred by the house of representatives the memorial of Winthrop Sargent Secretary of the º Northwest of the Ohio" respectfully reports thereupon as follows The second Section of the Act to provide for the Government of the Territory Northwest of the Ohio authorises and requires the Secretary thereof in Case of the Death removal resignation or necessary absence of the Governour of the said Territory to execute all the powers and perform all the Duties of the Governour during the vacancy or Absence— - It appears as detailed in a paper under the Signature of the memorialist that in Consequence of Absences of the Governour (partly occasioned by Calls of public Duty elsewhere, partly by ill health) the memorialist has had to perform the Duties of Governour pursuant to the above mentioned Section for a more considerable portion of the Time since his Appointment than was probably contemplated in fixing the Salary of his Office— The memorialist suggests his having had to sustain during this Time considerably greater Expenses than would have attended him had he not had to act as the Substitute for the Governour—though he exhibits no Statement of the additional Expense— It is naturally to be inferred that his Suggestion must be well founded, and that as well in reference to the additional Service which must have been thrown upon the memorialist as to the additional Expense to which he was subjected the Salary of seven hundred and fifty Dollars annexed by Law to the Office he holds must have been under the Circumstances of the Case an inadequate Compensation— It is for the Wisdom of the Legislature to decide how far these equitable Considerations may justify or demand a retrospective allowance in addition to that Compensation— The Secretary forbears to give an opinion (doubting whether it would be within the Intent of the reference to him) whether the Salary itself independent of particular Circumstances, be an adequate Compensation for an Officer whom the Law charges occasionally with the important Trust of acting in the Capacity of Governour All which is respectfully submitted * Jamy 31* 1794  Nº 2 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  [February 7, 1794) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE U. S. The Secretary of State begs the favor of the attorney-general of the United States, to give his opinion upon the inclosed extract from a note of the Secretary of the territory of the United States, north-west of the river Ohio.* PHILADEL* February 7th 1794. “Philadelphia, 3% of January 1794. “The Secretary of the territory of the United States north-west of the river Ohio begs leave to represent to the honorable the Secretary of State that considerable inconveniencies accrue to the Inhabitants of Vincennes upon the Oubashe River by a delay of the patents for the donation Lands to the ancient Settlers thereof. “Some doubts in the mind of the Governor whether those patents are to be issued by the general government or himself is the cause of this delay—And the opinion of the Secretary of State is requested thereupon.” 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE: SARGENT'S MEMORIAL  [February 13, 1794) The Committee to whom was refered the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" on the memorial of Winthrop Sargent Secretary of the Territory of the United States north west of the river Ohio" Report as followeth" That it appears to your Committee that the said memorialist did execute the several Duties of Governour of the said Territory as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury in the Absence of the Governour, who was most of that Time employed as Commander in Chief of the Army, on the Expedition against the Indians. Your Committee conceive, that the said memorialist, in the Discharge of such Duties, in the absence of the Governour, did no more than was contemplated by the second second Section of the Act providing for the Government of the Territory Northwest of the river Ohio. Your Committee also report, that from the official Statements of the Secretary of the Treasury, of the Expenditures of the civil List, laid before the house, that Arthur Sº Clair, the Governour of the said Territory has received his full Salary, for the years 1791 and 1792– Your Committee also report that it appears by a Certificate of Joseph Howell accountant to the War Department, that the said Arthur Sº Clair has received his full pay, Subsistance and Forage, from the fourth of march 1791 to the 6* of April 1792 as major General of the late Army against the Indians. The Committee upon the whole on a full and mature Consideration of the memorial and report of the Secretary of the Treasury thereupon are of Opinion that a second Salary of Governour ought not to be allowed—The first Salary of Governour having been already received by Arthur Sº Clair the present Governour for the years 1791 and 1792. The Committee further report that the Secretary of the Government of the Territory Northwest of the river Ohio ought to receive the pay of the Governour when discharging the Duties of that Office, and that a Bill be brought in for that purpose regulating the same in future.”  Nº 3 Report of a Committee to whom was refered the report of the Secretary of the Treasury upon the memorial of W Sargent

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  [March 19, 1794] THE SECRETARY OF WAR– The Secretary of State has the honor of returning to the Secretary of War the instructions, prepared for General Wayne, as sole negotiator with the Indians “– It is presumed from the shape, which the instructions have taken, that the President has determined to appoint General Wayne to that Office. Otherwise reasons would now be offered, why such a nomination ought not to take place. Was it not understood, that the instructions were to wait, until General Wayne should be heard from again? This is wished for the purpose of farther deliberation on the subject; tho' the instructions appear from a hasty reading to be intitled in general to approbation. If they cannot wait E. Randolph will call at the War-Office, and note some particulars to General Knox— March 19th 1794. 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE [SD: Letters Atty. Gen., 1792–1810: ALS 93) Mar. 25th 1794 SIR In answer to your enquiry, Whether the President of the United States or the Governor of the Western Territory ought to issue patents for the Lands granted to the inhabitants of Vincennes upon the Oubashe river,” I have now the honor to state to you my opinion. It appears that Congress by their resolve of the 20" June 1788 " directed that three tracts of Land should be laid out in the form of parallelograms for the benefit of those inhabitants, which were to be distributed amongst them by lot in the proportion of 400 acres for each family & immediate possession given: but no title could be acquired untill they had resided thereon three years from the time of such distribution. By the act of 3. March 1791* The Governor of the Western Territory is directed to lay out three tracts of Land agreeably to the said act of 20° June 1788: but he is not authorised to make any conveyances or patents to the settlers for their respective allotments. It is remarkable that he is empower'd to carry the first part of the said resolve into complete effect & to confirm the title of the settlers to other lands claimed by them; and also to make grants of Land not exceeding 100° to certain settlers who had not obtained any donation Land under the former acts. The opinion of Congress may therefore be inferred that the Governor of the Western Territory is the proper officer to issue the patents, or grants, in question: but if that was their opinion they have not expressed it: nor are the words of the act broad enough to implicate any such power. I am also of opinion that there is nothing in the Constitution or laws that invests the President with authority to issue patents to these settlers. If therefore patents are thought necessary to confirm the titles which the individuals have acquired by allotment & residence, agreeably to the provision of the resolve of the 20 June 1788—it remains with Congress to direct by whom they shall be issued.” I have the honor to be with great Esteem Sir Your most Obed" Serv. SECRETARY OF STATE  Bradford W. March 25.94. recº March 31, 94 
SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  PHILADELPHIA April 19° 1794. SIR-I observe in the report of the United States Attorney upon the subject of Donation Lands in the Western Territory that he has taken up the Business in a view only of the people upon the Mississipi and passed over those of the Oubashe who seem unconditionally to be entitled to Patents for their several proportions, as the same has long since been allotted to them agreeably to order of Congress. The Attorney General is of opinion the Governor should grant those Patents, and that such was probably the intention of Congress, but that no power for this purpose has been delegated to him.–nor is the President of the United States authorised so to do.”—If Sir, Congress shall not take this subject into consideration during the present Session very many of the Citizens in the Government North west of the Ohio must suffer injury by the delay. I take leave Sir to request the answer of the President to the Petition of Mr Freeman for the Life of his Son,' And have the honour to be with every sentiment of respect Your most Obedient, HONble Mr RANDOLPH WINTHROP SARGENT.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR AND SECRETARY SARGENT  PHILADELPHIA, May 15* 1794. THE GOVERNOR OF THE NORTH-WESTERN TERRITORY. SIR/ It is not without regret, that the President of the United States finds himself compelled to express to you, through me, his dissatisfaction at your long absence from the exercise of your functions in the government North-west of the Ohio. He has on all occasions wished to indulge public Officers with reasonable intermissions from duty; and he would be extremely unwilling to produce unnecessarily any private inconvenience to their affairs. But, being sworn to see the Laws executed, and resolved to prevent those criticisms, which must inevitably be made, upon his supposed sanction to lengthy and perhaps injurious suspensions of public service, he has instructed me to urge your return to the discharge of your office— I have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, Yo. mo. ob. Serv.– EDM: RANDOLPH. The same to Winthrop Sargent Esq.” Secretary of the Northwestern territory—  The two Letters immediately preceding were not sent, being superseded by an interview; which produced an explanation to the President in writing; upon which he has since said nothing more to the Secretary of State— 
STATEMENT OF SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  [May, 1794] Statement of Mº Sargent's Business before Congress upon the 20" of May—from the Commencement. In the year 1787 Congress appointed Mº Sargent the Secretary of their Western Territory constituting it his Duty to preserve the Laws that should be adopted and made—to record the Proceedings of the Governour, and to transmit to them Copies of the same, Ordering him as a salary therefor seven hundred & fifty Dollars per Annum— In the August of 1789 they directed that in addition to the Duties then incumbent upon him he should perform all those of the Governour during any of his Absences,” thereby very much accumulating his Services and Expences which in 1790 (and by the first opportunity that presented) He stated in a Letter to the President of the United States, requesting that due Provision might be made therefor,” and near the close of the same year obtained permission to come on to Philadelphia to urge in person this Suit—which was then no ways advanced—not because “the President did not deem the same reasonable” (as the Secretary of State informed Mº Sargent) “but because it was improper that any pecuniary Concerns should originate with him”—and further, “that means would have been devised in the Case of his Absence to have brought forward this Business but being here he had better take measures for that purpose himself”—which was accordingly done in a memorial presented to the house of representatives in the Decº of 1790 –and then referred to the Secretary of the Treasury.* Upon the 1* of Feb’1791 some of the settlements upon the Ohio having been attacked by the Indians, and the Presidents Pleasure for his Departure signified, he then again repaired to the western Territory as a Substitute for the Governour. The Secretary of the Treasury had not at this Time reported upon his memorial, but he believed however that he would soon have done it, and favourably— and he had assurances from Gentlemen of Congress that ample Compensation would be made him for all additional services—In full faith of this he has made his Calculations, and actually accommodated his Disbursements to the Salary of two thousand Dollars allowed the Governour—presuming he would be entitled to receive the same whilst he was discharging all his as well as the Secretary's Duties— The delay in adjustment of this Business subjects Mº S--in the present moment to very considerable Embarrassments. For more than three years has he been in a State of Suspense — Although no Exertion on his part was wanting, a report could not be obtained upon his memorial until the middle of the present session, and in a great proportion of the Time he has peen involved in the accumulated Services and Expenses of Governour and Secretary upon the pay of the Secretary only. Mº Hamiltons Report has been favourable,” & the house of representatives have thought proper to commit the same to Mess" Heth, Montgommery and Foster Who report That the Secretary of the Territory Northwest of the Ohio ought to receive the pay of the Governour when discharging his Duties—and that a Bill be brought in to provide for the same in future—but that the Governour having received the pay for part time, no Compensation can be made to the Secretary—" This Opinion however may be combatted by Gentlemen who believe that the Secretary has performed Services uncompensated— The Difference between Secretary and Governours pay whilst Mº Sargent has actually been discharging the Duties of both offices will exceed three Thousand Dollars—a sum very important to a man of small Fortunes, and rendered much more so by the Expenses of two Journies from the western Country and a long attendance at the seat of Government, But he trusts that all this will be duly considered and equitably provided for when the report shall be called up— WINTHROP SARGENT PHILADELPHIA May–1794 SECRETARY OF STATE– THE POSTMASTER GENERAL carry the mail on the Ohio between Wheeling and Limestone. I have been asked, whether such batteaux, as are used on the Mohawk river (the bottoms quite flat) would not be most suitable for the Ohio. I pretend not to determine, boats, that will be pushed with the most Ease and Swiftness and which at the same time will draw very little water, must doubtless be the most suitable. I leave this to Your Discretion. As some doubts are entertained of the practicability of carrying the Mail by the Ohio with due Regularity and Dispatch, it will be proper to have the first arrangements temporary. For which reason I request You to engage the boatmen on the Condition, that they may be discharged upon one or two months Notice, in case this mode of carrying a mail to Kentuckey & the Army should not answer the public Expectation concerning it and thence I should be induced to abandon it. I hope to hear from You by the next Mail. A packet or packets franked by me will go in this day's mail, which I pray you to forward as directed. Perhaps General Scott will not have left Pittsburg, when this arrives. In which case he would take charge of them. The one for Fort Washington You will forward by him also, or by any other Conveyance, which You shall judge more direct or certain. I am &" T. P. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JUDGE PUTNAM  GENERAL POST OFFICE PHIL” May 24, 1794 GENERAL RUFUS PUTNAM Marietta SIR It is proposed to attempt the carriage of a mail from Pittsburg to Wheeling by land, and thence by water to Limestone. From Limestone by a new road on the Southern side of the Ohio to the mouth of Licking, opposite to Fort Washington, where it will cross over. From Limestone the mail will be carried thro’ the State of Kentucky: the post road thro’ the Wilderness, in this case to be discontinued. I have given directions to have three boats constructed for the purpose, to be formed in the best manner for ease and expedition, in pushing up stream, to be managed by five hands each. I hope they will be running some time in June. Marietta will be a station for the boats to stop at as they pass; and doubtless it will be convenient to have a post office there. Herewith I send a packet addressed to you, to be put into the hands of the person you judge to be most suitable for postmaster. He will there see the forms in which the business] is to be transacted with which he should make himself acquainted. The law” now sent will expire in a few days; it is substantially the same as the new law,” as to the regulations. The latter will be forwarded when prepared. The person you designate for Postmaster should be careful and trusty; and there will be an advantage in having one whose residence will be near the Landing place of the mail boats. The advantages of a regular mail will be so great to your settlement I am sure you will omit nothing to secure them.” I am & T. P. P. S. I suppose a Postoffice may be eligible at Gallipolis," for which I send a second packet addressed to you to be disposed of as you think fit. You will be so good as to favor me with an answer as soon as possible 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JUDGE PUTNAM  GENERAL POST OFFICE June 7. 1794 GENERAL RUFUS PUTNAM SIR I wrote you on the 24th ult” & sent two packages, for the establishment of post offices at Marietta and Gallipolis. Major Craig informs me that the mail boats which are preparing at Pittsburg will soon be ready. I supposed their crews would have been engaged there: but Major Craig writes me, that he had consulted Capt. Mills of Marietta who told him that he would procure at Marietta a trusty boatmaster and four good hands, for one boat to ply between that place and Gallipolis and that another set of excellent hands might be engaged at Gallipolis, for the boat which is to ply between that place and Limestone. It does not appear that Major Craig has given any direction for raising this third set: if he has he will inform you; and on defect of such information, permit me to ask of you the favour to take such steps as you shall effectual & best to engage this third boats crew, expeditiously. Be pleased to speak with Capt. Mills on the subject and to advise Major Craig at what time both setts will be ready.— Perhaps they may be so engaged that their pay need not begin till near the time when their actual service will commence.—Col” O Hara” & Major Craig both informed me that hands could be engaged at 12 dollars a month and rations at 15 cents each now they think that good hands cannot be obtained under 15, nor boat-masters under 20.- The difference of 3 dollars a month will increase considerably the expence of the undertaking which without such addition will be very great. However it must now be encountered if unavoidable” I am &c T. P. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO GEORGE MITCHELL 20  GENERAL POST OFFICE PHIL” June 20. 1794 GEORGE MITCHELL Esq." SIR I wrote you on the 24" of May, & 14th instant * relative to the establishment of the mail by the way of the Ohio. It was then my intention & expectation to provide for the carriage of the mail in your state, by contract. But until an experiment has been made by the Ohio, I cannot obtain the requisite facts. I have therefore concluded for the present, to hire riders, on the best terms which can be obtained, for the residue of the roads in your state, as well as from Limestone to Fort Washington, for which I have already requested you to make provision. I wrote lately to Gen' Barbee, the postmaster at Danville, praying him to hire riders accordingly. Major Craig at Pittsburg writes me that the mail boats are prepared. This I expect will go to you in the first to be followed by the others regularly, once a week. As soon as this first mail arrives at Limestone, I request you to forward the inclosed letter to General Barbee, by the first conveyance which shall present; and he will then set riders in motion, to attend your office weekly. Having advised the Secretary of War of this establishment, I expect some dispatches will come to his office. Other dispatches will doubtless go from Pittsburg & other places. As soon as they arrive at Limestone, I pray you to send them to Fort Washington & to provide, as I formerly requested, for a regular weekly conveyance to and from that place. The uniform practice in the department requires that each deputy give bond with sureties for the performance of the duties of the office, and take and subscribe the Oaths prescribed by law. The bond and oaths for you are now inclosed, in which be pleased to fill up the blanks. I have presumed on your accepting the post-office at Limestone and I hope nothing will occur to prevent it. However lest it should be otherwise, I add to my requests this one, that you will place the papers in the hands of some other fit person, that the business now ripe for execution may not be interrupted or delayed. A key to unlock the mail is inclosed. It is to have this security as soon as the requisit provision of saddle bags or portmanteaus shall be made.” I am & T. P. P. S. I shall be much obliged by your writing to Gen' Barbee, to inform him on what day weekly the mails may be expected at Limestone, from Pittsburg & when the first mail arrives. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT  GEN POST OFFICE PHIL” June 20, 1794 THE POSTMASTER AT GALLIPOLIS SIR. Having no knowledge of any persons at Gallipolis, I sent to General Putnam at Marietta certain papers relative to the establishment of a post office at the former place, as well as at Marietta. This letter I transmit to him, that he may give the proper direction. Inclosed is a key to unlock the mail, and a bond to be executed as usual with sureties, and the forms of the oaths to be taken by the person accepting the Post-Office. When the bond and oaths are returned, a commission will be sent you In the mean time the business may commence, as soon as the bond is executed and the oaths taken and subscribed. Three boats are engaged, to ply between Wheeling and Limestone, in three stages—one from Wheeling to Marietta—one thence to Gallipolis—and the third thence to Limestone—whence the mail will be sent by land to Fort Washington. By this arrangement, a mail will be passing up and down the Ohio every week. This at least is the plan; and from the information given me, I have room to expect it will succeed. The law included in the package destined for your office, and the tables of rates, will enable you to mark the proper postage on the letters going from your office. The distances on the river, you must take according to the best estimation you can obtain * I wish for an answer by the first opportunity; and am &c T. P.
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JUDGE PUTNAM  GENERAL POST OFFICE PHIL* June 20. 1794 RUFUS PUTNAM Esq." SIR I wrote you on May 24th.* & June 7th.” relative to the carriage of a mail by the Ohio, and the Establishment of post-offices at Marietta and Gallipolis. Those letters I hope will have reached you, and the persons have been designated for postmasters at those places. To day I received advice from Major Craig that one boat and crew were ready, and that the other two would be ready to follow her weekly. At Limestone the mails by the Ohio are to be sent by land to Fort Washington. George Mitchell Esqº was named to me for postmaster at Limestone, and I desired him to make provision for carrying the mail thence to Fort Washington. I inclose herein a key for the postmaster at Marietta, for the lock which will secure the mail; and a packet for the postmaster at Gallipolis, also inclosing a key; to which I request you to give the proper direction. The persons accepting the offices must give bond with sureties, and take the oaths prescribed by law. These are now forwarded, for both places.” I hope shortly to have the pleasure of an answer; and remain your & T. P. 
THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT  WAR DEPARTMENT June 25, 1794 SIR, Last evening I received a letter from Major General Wayne dated the 26" of May,” and from the Deputy Quarter Master General at Fort Washington dated the 31* of the same month.* I enclose a copy of the General's letter. General Scott would probably arrive at Fort Washington about the 6" instant, his instructions therefore would not militate with Wayne's arrangements as the latter in a letter to Gov". Shelby says that General Scott would expect to command. On the 13" of May some Savages attacked an escort carrying Provisions from Fort Washington to Fort Hamilton killed five out of six of the advanced Guard but were repulsed with the loss of one killed and six rifles taken, but they carried off some horses, so says Wilkinson. I have also another private letter from General Wilkinson in which he says on the subject of provisions “The strife between the Contractors and the General appears to increase, but our provisions increase also, and I think all difficulty on this head must soon cease, as a competition in the purchase of Beef Cattle, has taken place between them, which must soon secure a sufficient stock.” ” The other parts of the letter complain of the detachment at Fort Massac as not being sufficient. That General Wayne had suspected that he, Wilkinson, had been the cause of the defaults of the Contractors.30 I myself am pretty well convinced that the contractors will not fail for want of flour, as by the enclosed letter from Mº Williams it appears that they must have at Fort Washington and advanced of it, one Year's supply for five thousand Men—but the transport may be doubted, General Wayne's intelligence of Simcoe's being at the Miami rapids is drawn from a distant source, to wit, some reports at Cahokia on the Mississippi May the 6” and therefore not to be depended on. He appears to know nothing immediately from the rapids. I have received a letter from General Chapin dated the 12" Instant,” a copy of which is enclosed. The narrative mentioned is not material excepting as to the dissatisfaction excited among the six nations by the Presq'ue Isle business” and the confirmation of the british erecting a post at the Miami with the idea of its being an indian fortification. I have the honor to be Sir, with perfect respect Your obedient Servant H KNOX THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  From The Secrety of War 25” June 1794
JONATHAN DAYTON TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , ELIZABETH TOWN June 26th 1794 DEAR SIR, Judge Symmes, who left this place yesterday for Philadelphia by the way of Morristown, requested me to acquaint you that in two or three days he should be at your office to obtain the Deed for the Miami lands.” The delay of this business, on one account or another, has been so much beyond what was foreseen, as to occasion much uneasiness with many of the interested, & to induce me to urge it's completion with all possible dispatch. If you have leisure, be so good as to inform me what are your accounts from the Westward—whether Wayne is to be reinforced & directed to advance, and whether Simcoe or any of the British troops have actually taken post, as was reported, within our territory. With the highest regard Yours JONA: DAYTON [Addressed] The Honble Alexander Hamilton Esq." Philadelphia  Eliz-Town June 26–94 J. Dayton Jon" Dayton 26 June 1794 Free 
JONATHAN DAYTON TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , ELIZABETH Town August 9th 1794 D* SIR, Will you be so obliging as to turn your attention immediately to the subject of Judge Symmes's purchase between the Miamis, in order to have the different writings prepared for executing upon his arrival in Philadelphia, which will be in four or five days? The final completion of the business has been from one cause or another, so much protracted beyond what was foreseen or expected, that it has occasioned considerable uneasiness on the part of the concerned.” With sentiments of perfect esteem I am Dr Sir Yours JONA: DAYTON THE HONBLE COLO: HAMILTON. [Addressed] The Honble Alexander Hamilton Esq. Philadelphia Free  E-Town Aug. 11–949 July 1794 Mr Dayton 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO MAJOR ISAAC CRAIG  GENERAL POST OFFICE August 23. 1794 MAJOR ISAAC CRAIG Pittsburg SIR I have been favoured with your letter of the 15th.” covering the papers relative to the carriage of the mail by the Ohio, and the bonds of Major Finlay "postmaster at Wheeling, whose commission I forward this day. I was apprehensive of the difficulty mentioned in the letter of Col” Mitchell, and regretted that the settlements on the Ohio would not admit of a more equal division of the distance among the three boats. I cannot think of going to the great expence of another boat.— Would there be any objection to the first boat's going to Bel Pre? I presume there is some settlement there. If there is any settlement about twenty miles below Gallipolis, the second boat might go thither, and then the third accomplish the voyage to Limestone. The most accurate account of distances I suppose is one furnished me by Col" Sargeant, formed on his own very careful observation. They here follow; Wheeling to Marietta . . . . 86 to Bel Pre lower end . . 19 . . 105 Bel Pre to Gallipolis . . . . 86 Little Guyandatta . . . 18 . . 104 Little Guyandatta to Limestone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 128 337 If the settlements on the Ohio will admit of the above division, or of any other which will more equally distribute the labour of the boats hands, than the present one, you are at full liberty to make it.—If any division than the present one is impracticable, I see no way of relieving M' Dugan and his hands but by shifting the stations of all the boats, by regular tours.-I confess that I did not reckon, originally, on allowing much idle time to the boatmen, under an idea of resting: so much ease as was necessary I expected they would have when going down stream; and that, you may remember, we contemplated when making the arrangement. I intended to have sent the portmanteaus or saddle bags for the Kentucky mails from Philadelphia. This cannot now be done. I called at M* Hodgson's store this morning to see the horsemen's portmanteaus, or valeeces. I think they will answer for the present. He supposes you have some in store. In this case I pray you to forward three to Col” Mitchell—one for the Fort-Washington route— one for the route to Danville—& the third for the route thence to Louisville. But before they are sent, they should be fixed with each a strap to reeve like the strap of a pair of saddle bags, with an iron rivetted at the end, & shaving a mortice in it to go over a staple, for the purpose of locking up the mail. The other end of the strap should be rivetted to the portmanteau, to render it secure. This little improvement I hope you will be able to make.—If you have no such portmanteaus, then I pray you to purchase three pair of large saddle bags and forward them to Col” Mitchell. The straps of them should be fixed as before mentioned, for the purpose of locking. I send herewith the lock for which the staples must be fitted, being much larger than the ordinary portmanteau locks. How is the mail secured when in the boats? I shall be much obliged by your information on this and every other matter concerning this business. As to the pay of the boatmen, if you can provide for it, and draw on me monthly for the amount, your draughts shall be paid at sight. So also as to the post-rider to Wheeling. Or if quarterly payments will answer, it would be more agreeable as occasioning less trouble to us both: but let it be made agreeable to the boatmen.” I am &c T. P.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE [SF:3 Cong., 2 sess.: C “] . MARIETTA Dec 15th 1794. SIR, By the Ordinance of Congress establishing the Government of the Western Territory, the Supreme Judicial authority is vested in three Judges, two of whom were necessary to form a Court, with power to decide in all matters without appeal, and by a Law of Congress, one of those Judges is made competent, also without appeal. Many representations, Sir, have been made to me on this Subject— the people, very generally, think it an unsafe Situation which they are in; and indeed, taking the matter abstractedly, it cannot be thought very eligible, that the whole property of a Country which may [be] the subject of legal dispute, should be governed by the determination of a single Judge, without the possibility of having that determination revised. But circumstances exist at present that render it dangerous for them. The principal Settlements have been made on tracts of Land purchased by certain companies or associations of persons. The first of those is the Ohio Company, and the next that of the Miami. In both these associations, the management of the directors and agents, are thought to have laid the foundation of endless disputes. General Putnam has been the active director in the first association, and M Symmes the principal, if not the sole agent in the second; and they are both Judges of the Supreme Court. Every land dispute will be traced to some transaction of one or other of those Gentlemen in those capacities, and they are to sit in Judgement upon them. It must be acknowledged that this is not a groundless cause of apprehension; for, tho' they are both of very fair character, and delicacy would prevent their Judging in any case where they are themselves parties, Interest hangs an insensible bias on the minds of the most upright men, and in the matters that are most likely to be litigated, in which ever of the associations they happen, there must necessarily be so great a similarity that, deciding in one by a Judge who has no direct interest in the cause, may nevertheless have as direct & certain an effect in another wherein he is interested as if he had determined in his own cause. I believe, Sir, it would therefore be well if–law impowering one Judge to hold the Court could be repealed, and that some mode, were prescribed for bringing the decisions of the Supreme Court here, before the Federal Court, either by direct appeal, or by Writ of Error, or both as cases may require.” It appears to me, Sir, to be necessary for rendering the people easy and safe; and there are also political ends that would, clearly be served by it, for there is perhaps nothing that contributes more to induce an affectionate Submission to any power, than the habit of looking up to that power as the depositary and dispenser of Justice in the last resort. I have thought it my duty to make you acquainted with the fears and wishes of the people upon this Subject, and have the honor to be with great respect, Sir, Your most obedient Servant A*S* CLAIR.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT'S SECRETARY, 9 °Clock Eve 16. Dec 1794 DEAR SIR Please to submit to the President of the U.S., the enclosed letters from Gen' Wayne of the 17" October,” (duplicate the first not received) and the 12" of Nov.” They have been just received I have not perused the enclosures conceiving it proper that the President should see the letters as early as possible in the morning as some measure may be proper to be taken thereon in order to lay them before Congress. I shall therefore wait upon him at 9 °Clock tomorrow morning to take his orders respecting the papers.” Yours H KNOX  From The Secy of War 16 Dec 1794 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO GEORGE MITCHELL  GENERAL POST OFFICE Jam) 2. 1795 M" GEORGE MITCHELL PM" at Limestone SIR. The long distance of 145 miles from Gallipolis to Limestone, having been found too great to be traversed by one boat, I wrote last August to Major Craig" to endeavor to make a more equal division of the whole distance from Wheeling to Limestone but this I supppose was not found practicable.—By a letter of the Major's dated 17" of Octo” he says you had informed him that you had provided a fourth boat, to meet the mail boat Nº. 3, & by that means you expected regularity in the conveyance. In the same letter the Major says he had “transmitted means of payment of all the mail boat crews up to Oct 1. 1794.” Yet you mention in yours of Nov 23* which is just received, that they had not been paid. Perhaps the Major provided for the three upper boats only. If so, your draught on the General post office for the pay of your boats crew, & also of the post rider from Limestone to Cincinnati, up to the first of January instant shall be paid at sight. I presume there will be no difficulty in your negociating such a bill. In that Case you can pay the men & take their receipts; A plain account of their wages & the payments to be sent with the draught or before it. It will be well to take duplicate receipts, lest some failure should happen those you transmit. I am sorry to learn that provisions have not been duly supplied to the boatmen. I shall write Major Craig on that subject.”— The great want of regularity & expedition in the conveyance of the mail by the Ohio defeats the object of its establishment which at the same time is very expensive. Colº Orr “ has suggested that the mail may be carried by land from Preston 25 or 26 miles above Washington. This would reduce the range of the mail boat Nº. 3 to 120 miles. If with this reduction the trip backward & forward can be performed in 7 days, I would by all means wish to make the change for the expence of a 4" boat will greatly exceed that of a post rider. In this case the rider to Cincinnati may take in this additional distance to preston & be paid for it what is reasonable.—This I suppose would give him constant employment; for I think in one of your letters you state the distance from Limestone to Cincinnati at 78 miles by land—deduct 4 for the distance from Washington to Limestone, leaving 68, & adding 25 from Washington to preston you have 93 miles as great a distance as it may be convenient to travel twice over in a week. If this plan be practicable it is very desirable to have it put in execution; & because much time will be lost before your answer can be received & a reply returned, I would wish to leave the matter to your judgement. If you approve of it let it be done without delay; what you determine be pleased to communicate to the General post office.— Your Solicitude to have the mail by the Ohio continued—the interest of that Country, & the great convenience of Government, so strongly requiring it—I have no doubt of your cheerfully rendering your aid to effect it, in a manner the most unexceptionable.—The enormous expence of this mail, is a powerful objection to the continuance of it. To place it therefore on a footing the most oeconomical, will demand & receive your attention; & for this you will lay the public under great obligations.— January 10* The foregoing was intended to have been sent by the last mail but before other letters on the subject could be ready the hour for closing the mail arrived. Since that time I have read the letters from you & others which were received during my absence of more than three months on an indian treaty.” I am now induced to think you did not provide a 4" boat: for in your letter without date but which must have been written in Sep' you suggest that you could send two men in a Canoe to meet the 3" boat between the Big sandy and the Scioto—which you had mentioned to Major Craig. The alteration therefore which I have mentioned on the information of M* Orr & Mr Brown " may be immediately made. I mean for the 3" boat to go no lower down than Preston; & for the Post rider to receive the mail there & convey it by land through Washington to Cincinnati.”— T. P. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO MAJOR ISAAC CRAIG  GENERAL P. OFFICE PHILAD" Jamy 10. 1795. MAJOR ISAAC CRAIG SIR, The great delays of the mail by the Ohio nearly defeat the object of the establishment, while it is attended with an enormous expence. It is Gen' Putnam's opinion, that a military post at Scioto would enable us so to divide the whole distance from Wheeling to Fort Washington, that four boats would perform their trips with certainty, each in one week.” This idea of Gen' Putnam's of establishing a Post at Scioto, I communicated to Gen.' Knox, before I went to the treaty with the six Nations: but I suppose, it was not thought expedient or circumstances did not admit of it. I have now, on the information of Mº Brown & Col' Orr, of Kentuckey, proposed to Col” Mitchell of Limestone to employ a Post Rider to take the mail at Preston, 25 miles above Limestone and to let the mail-boat Nº 3 stop at Preston." This will reduce the range of that boat to 120 miles, and if the Boat Nº. 2. can stay at Gallipolis  one or two days longer, than it did in Summer I should hope, the original plan might still be executed. The boat Nº. 1. must in like manner wait at Marietta for boat Nº. 2. This I suggest on the information of Gen' Putnam in his letter of the 30" of August " in which he says, that the boats from Marietta to Wheeling & from Marietta to Gallipolis at that time performed their tours easily in five days. The winter & high water may make some difference: still I hope some time may be gained in this way, and to that I beg your immediate attention: Sending the requisite Orders to the Master boatmen. A letter from Mr M"Clure of Washington mentions the arrangement of the mail between Pittsburg & Wheeling, since the short days and bad roads retarded the arrival of the mail from Philad" to be so preposterously fixed, that the P Rider to Wheeling is sent off from Pittsburg before the arrival of the mail from Philad" which of course lays a week at Pittsburg. This is such an absurdity as scarcely to be credible. Your agreement with the P Rider is perfectly right—he is to arrive in Wheeling in 24 hours after the mail is closed at Pittsburg: but you do not confine him to any hour of a certain day, when to depart. Let him therefore always be detained, till he gets the Philad" mail, according to the great design of the Establishment and the plain meaning of your agreement with him. Whatever subordinate arrangements Shall be necessary on the subject of this letter, I beg you to make. I pray you also to cause provisions of a good quality or the price of the rations to be furnished to all the boats crews and to provide for a regular payment of their wages. Your draughts on the General P Office for the means will meet with due honour. I am &c T. P. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JUDGE PUTNAM, G. P. O. Jamuary 16. 1795 GEN' RUFUS PUTNAM Marietta DEAR SIR Tho' appointed to the department of war,” yet as nobody has yet been appointed postmaster general,” I occasionally do business in that department.—I feel particularly concerned to do it when it respects arrangements which I began, but which from any cause have not fully succeeded.—I believe you know that at first it was proposed to employ 4 boats to ply between Pittsburg, or rather wheeling, & Fort Washington. Afterwards it was found that the mail might be carried by land from Limestone to Fort Washington. This lessened the distance about 70 miles: & as on enquiry there appeared to be no stations for exchanging the mails but Marietta, Gallipolis & Limestone these were fixed on for the purpose.—The consequence was that the boat Nº. 3. plying between Gallipolis, 145 was seldom or ever in time. To remedy this mischief, Col” Mitchell suggested to Major Craig that he could send a Canoe to meet the mail from Gallipolis; & from Major Craig's letter to Gen' post office received during my absence on a treaty with the six nations, it was understood that this proposition of Col” Mitchells had been carried into effect—But on examining Col" Mitchells letters to the post-office, I concluded that the measure was merely suggested & not executed— The consequence of the failure of the 3" boat has been such intolerable delay of the mail, as almost to discourage a prosecution of the plan of conveying a mail by the Ohio–combining with the delay the great expence attending it. Lately the Kentucky gentlemen have proposed that the mail should stop at Preston, 25 or 26 miles on this side Limestone. This will reduce the range of the 3" boat to 120 miles. I have assented to this proposition, & last week wrote to Col” Mitchell to send the post rider from Limestone up to Preston, to take the mail thence by land to Washington (which is 4 miles from Limestone) thence to Fort Washington. This will increase his ride to near 100 miles & give him pretty constant employment. Mess' Jn” & George Graham are the Gentlemen at preston to whom I have written to receive the mail from the boat & deliver the one from below. I have further proposed that the boat Nº. 2 which by one of your letters I see had two spare days to wait one or both of them for the arrival of Boat Nº. 3 & in like manner boat Nº. 1 would wait for Boat Nº. 2. In this manner I have hopes that a regular conveyance of this mail may be effected. But my dear sir, I have not given you this detail merely for information: I am solicitous to commit the whole business to your direction. Your situation is peculiarly favorably for the purpose as 9 boats weekly arrive at Marietta. I know too for yourself as for the country where you reside you feel most interested to give success to some plan of carrying the mail by the Ohio. I have therefore to request & you are hereby fully authorized to make such arrangements for the purpose as you shall judge best—I am told that the duty of the boats N° 1 & 2 is so light that 2 out of the 4 hands are alternately left at home. Now this cannot be right. If not necessary for the service they should be discharged.—Or if still the duty of boat Nº. 3 should be too severe, 1 or 2 hands should be added to their present complement.—What I have said in this letter respecting the management of the boats, you will please to consider merely as hints; the actual arrangement to produce an efficient carriage of the mail, I beg you to make. I shall drop a line for Major Craig & Col” Mitchell to apprize them of the measures I have desired you to take. I shall desire Major Craig to pay regularly all the men employed, & to pay off any that may be discharged.— Your arrangements you will of course communicate to the General post office when I shall see them.— Should the indian war be continued (which God forbid) I shall not fail to communicate to the president your opinion of the utility of a small post at the mouth of the Scioto. I sent your letter on the subject to Gen' Knox soon after I received it T. P. P. S. It has been suggested to me that the mail boats are much too heavy for pushing with the requisite speed; will you favor me with your ideas on this subject & of the size & form of the boats best adapted to that service?

The result of the Conference at Greenville between General Wayne & the Indians is this. That a general treaty shall be held at Greenville about the 15th of next June, with the Chippawas, Ottawas, Pattawatamies, Sakies and Miamis, to conclude on articles of peace; agreeably to preliminary articles signed the 21st of January." In General Wayne's speech dated January 1st, to Tarhe & other Chiefs at Sandusky, he has this passage. “The Miamis say that the Chiefs of the remaining hostile tribes had acceeded to the prevailing opinion and wish for peace; and that those Chiefs are now on their way to this place (Greenville) & may be expected in the course of a few days after the arrival of the Chiefs of the five nations before mentioned.””— The papers received do not announce their arrival. The information of the Miamis was communicated by Col" Hamtranck from the post at the Miami Villages. I have thus mentioned the object and result of the conference for the President's information, if he should not have leisure to read all the papers, which are not interesting.—I may except the speech of Richardville, a Miami Chief, of one of the most hostile tribes, & which is very short—and the preliminary articles for suspending hostilities.” T.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO MAJOR ISAAC CRAIG  GEN POST OFFICE PHIL* March 25 1795 MAJOR CRAIG SIR I have this week received from Gen' Putnam his arrangement for carrying the Ohio mail.” By this the Boat Nº. 1 will ply between Wheeling and Marrietta; and the boats N° 2 & 3 will in turn perform the whole Voyage thence to Preston (Graham's Station) or Limestone. Thus all the three boats will come to Marrietta, where of course their Services will be ascertained, and can most conveniently to the crews & with most safety to the public be paid, as the wages become due, An arrangement will therefore be made for paying them at Mariette. For this reason you will be good enough to counter order the directions you gave Major Kirkpatrick to provide for paying them at Limestone or Gallipolis.

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JUDGE PUTNAM  [April 28, 1795) SIR A few days ago, I received a Letter from William Sº Clair Esq." Prothonotary and Register of the County of Sº Clair dated Dec. 20" 1794 enclosing a Copy of a Letter from You to him on the 5 Nov" in that year together with his Answer of the 11", and your replication of the 15"?"—These Letters, Sir, respect the Records of that County and the place where they have been deposited and kept, and the last contains a peremptory Order to deposit them at Kaskaskia, as being the acknowledged County Town where the general Court would soon sit. The General Court, Sir, may sit wherever the Judges think proper in any County, and it is to be presumed they will always use that discretion so as to render the Session most convenient to the Inhabitants in the County Town or otherwise as that may be but the Sessions of the supreme Court has nothing to do with the County Records—In any Case litigated in that Court where recourse to the County Records becomes necessary, I presume it would be the Duty of the party who had occasion for them to obtain authenticated transcripts of the necessary Papers where originals were not to be had—I believe it would be unsafe to have the Records on every occasion brought into Court—the Officer ought not to let them go out of his possession, and I think the Register of the County of Sº Clair was wrong in Doing so, even in obedience to your Order and the Person  who rec" them was wrong also, and would find if a prosecution should ensue that your authority would not justify him. I conceive, Sir that a Judge in his judicial Capacity, has not any thing to do with Record keepers, except upon complaint in common course of Law, for some misdemeanor in Office, and no Power, in any case over the Records.-These are my Ideas on the Subject, but I may be mistaken. I am sure I am not mistaken when I say you had no authority to intermeddle with Indian Affairs—and about all, with any accounts Current that might have been between M'S' Clair and me, but which, as he informs me, you demanded from him. I am sorry, Sir, that, on any accasion, I should differ in opinion with you, and still more so, that by any means the execution of official duties should have to they appear to me to be quite distinct, and it is my wish to keep them so— The Appointment to offices is the prerogative of the Governor. Many of the Offices and particularly the Registers are purely executive—if the persons appointed are incapable or unfaithful but in a degree not to be liable to criminal prosecution, it is his province to remove or correct them, & it is not until a crime has been committed that the judicial Courts interfere. As to County Towns, whether you think proper to acknowledge them or not, the Governor is by Law empowered to appoint the places where the Courts are to be held in each County—a law which also rec" your assent and you must have seen Sir that without such a Measure Justice could not have been administered at all, as each of the districts was too inconsiderable for a County, and all of them at too great a distance from each other to be united. As the records may be considered to be in your Custody, I should be glad if you would direct the Person to whom you have committed them to restore them to M'S' Clair—If that is not done, I must find some means to get them out of his hands. P. S.–In a letter of yours to Colonel Sargent which he sent to me I find this passage: “since the letter was delivered, M. St. Clair (who has not acted in the fairest manner possible), has put into my hands an open letter, etc.” As it is my duty to give the officers of government all due countenance and protection while they act with propriety, so it is my determination to bring them to punishment where they act improperly. I have therefore to request that you will be pleased to specify the instances when M. Sº Clair has acted unfairly, and I have written to him that such a charge is alleged against him, and that I have required the specification.  Copy to Judge Turner, April 28, 1795
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO SECRETARY SARGENT  MARIETTA, April 28, 1795. DEAR SIR:—Once more I am returned to the Territory and arrived at this place a few days ago. My absence from it at the time I had appointed a meeting of the Legislature must have surprised you, but I found it necessary to visit the settlements in the upper part of the County, and having a sum of money considerably at risque in Westmoreland County, I took that time which was near the session of Greensburgh Court, to which I would go in a few days, to secure it, and had calculated the whole time of my absence at two weeks; but the Winter set in so suddenly and with such violence that it was impossible to return had I been in a situation to attempt it. I was not, for at Greensburgh I was seized by the Gout and with difficulty got to my family tho’ but eighteen miles distant where I was confined to my bed in the most excruciating torture for upwards of two months. About the beginning of March, when a little recovered, I attempted the journey, and relapsed the second day in consequence, and on my journey now, was again attacked and confined upwards of a week in a miserable hovel by the way, notwithstanding which, tho' still lame and very feeble, I am in health, and shall recover again for a little while. I propose to set out for Cincinnati about the end of next week. At this place I found your letters of the 23rd ” and 27th of December,” of the 4th 7" and 24th of January and of the 14th of February last.” I have still to regret, Sir, that more than one letter I wrote to you, before my former arrival in the Territory, did not get to your hand. They would have prevented some mortification and saved some trouble to us both. The miscarriage of letters to and from me has been very extraordinary and unaccountable. I have also still to regret that either my recollection or yours, with respect to my passing last Winter at Muskingum, had not been perfectly correct; for, as I observed to you, I expected to have met you there, and in consequence of our conversation at Philadelphia doubted not in the least that tho' you were not arrived, you were on your way up, and looked for you eagerly and anxiously from day to day (which was the reason I did not write) until some person arrived from Fort Washington who had breakfasted with you the morning he set out from thence and informed me of your still being there without any thoughts of leaving it. It was not till then that I wrote you, because I supposed you on the River and any letter addressed to you at Cincinnati must necessarily have missed you. The prosecutions, however, these mistakes have given birth to need give you very little uneasiness, and as to the disposition of the people you had it not to learn. I can recollect no conversation, for a long time at least, on the subject of the seat of Government, but I can remember that we both thought Marietta would not answer, and, in the present circumstances, I still think so; but it was always my intention to keep it, so far as it depended upon me, unfixed till there should be an end of the Indian war, and the country laid open for settlement, after which it will probably be divided into more than one government, and it would be easier to determine the most eligible place, if it should not. While things remain in their present situation—while the establishments are so distant from each other and the communications so difficult—while there is not a single road thro' the country, I believe it would be improper to fix upon any place to which the inhabitants should be, in certain cases, obliged to resort; and that it will be necessary for some time to come that both the executive and legislative parts of government should be ambulatory— neither do I think the transportation of the records, as they are as yet far from being cumbrous, any strong objection to it. I doubt not but on reflection you will recollect this has always been my way of thinking. I assure you, Sir, it was neither pleasure nor emolument that led to it, but what appeared to me the interest of the people, for which the government was established. But if you suppose I wantonly took a step which would involve you in difficulty or expense, which from your frequently repeating the words “your pleasure,” and your readiness to acquiesce in it, it seems as if you had, you wrong me. It is contrary to my disposition to treat any person in the world in that manner, but above all a person I esteem as I do Colonel Sargent, whose convenience in every respect I shall always be happy to consult and contribute to. The letters of Mr. Vanderburgh I returned to you,” for I thought it would be more proper that he himself should address his complaint to the Secretary of State than that it should be made either by you or me, and I recommended that he should take that step. I hope and trust that you have received them. I have a letter from Mr. St. Clair of the Illinois country “complaining of very extravagant treatment he has met with also from Judge Turner, and informing me that in consequence of it he has written to you requesting leave to resign his offices.” I hope you have not complied with his request, and I wrote to him “to hold them at least until some means can be found to bring the Judge to reason. Should you be writing to St. Vincennes I wish you would procure a certified copy of the presentment of the Grand Jury against the Judge. From the present view of things, it seems to me that I shall be obliged to visit that country immediately to prevent, if it yet can be prevented, the subversion of all order, if not the total ruin of the country. Adieu, my dear Sir, always with great regard and affection, Your very humble servant, A. ST. CLAIR TO HON. WINTHROP SARGENT, Cincinnati. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGE TURNER  MARIETTA May 2' 1795 SIR By the Mail Boat from Cincinnati I rec" this morning the Letter you did me the honor to write on the 25 of November last,” which it seems was forwarded to that place by Express on the 28 of that month—I can account for the delays it has met with only from certain indorsements on the Cover, one of which is “Missent”—the other, “Cincinnati, 19" April, 1795.” I have extracted Sir several parts of that Letter particularly the three first paragraphs and enclosed them to the Secretary of War, and the 9th 10° 11" and 12” to the Secretary of State.” It gives me pain to hear of complaints against the Judges tho it is by no means improbable that they are ill-founded—I would, however, fondly hope that, if-they have been guilty of any improprieties, they have proceeded from a mistaken Judg", and not a perverted Will. I wish they had been confined to the notice sent. I have complaints of a serious nature that reach another District. You must be sensible Sir, that to find Persons in that Country, who are capable of performing the Duties of Judges in a strictly legal manner is impossible—It is true there have been but five Judges appointed in the Cy of St. Clair, and hard it was to find five in the Co” when it was laid out and, at that time, no more could be appointed if more qualified Persons could have been found. I shall be happy to find that it can produce more of that description now. If there are complaints against any of the County Officers, I am of opinion they should have been made to me, even if they were of such a Nature as to require a criminal prosecution—When brought before the general Court in that way, and I know of no other in which they can be brought before it, to be sure they would claim its Attention. You will pardon me Sir, I hope, if I doubt the power of that court to hold a special Session. The local Situation of the Inhabitants of the County of St. Clair, where they are divided into distinct and distant settlements, none sufficiently populous to furnish even the necessary Officers for a County, subjects them to great inconveniences. It was the only Reason for dividing the County into districts and an Expectation was had that an encrease of People would soon put it in the power of the Gov" to erect each district into a separate County, and of course those inconveniences would cease, but instead of encreasing the Numbers the People have decreased considerably some alteration will therefore be necessary, and I thank you Sir, for the hints you have suggested.” To all you have said with respect to Licenses and Indian Affairs, I will only repeat what in substance I had the honor to observe to you in my last, that I conceive the Indian Department to be wholly out of your Province, and to Add, that in my conception the Duties of a Judge are neither inquisitorial nor executive. As to what relates to the Secº, I know not Sir, whether it is intended as official complaint or private information only—if the first, as it is destitute of any testimony whereon to ground a prosecution, I cannot take notice of it—If it had been accompanied with testimony, I presume it is not to me it should have been addressed, for the Secº is not under my Control. The territorial statute is not only virtually repealed, but, in my Judg", always was a nullity. I have often thought of an Escheator, but, until the expiration of a certain form of the Estates which have been abandoned can not escheat and when they do it will be to the U. S., and not to the Territory—the same I believe with respect to those where no heirs are known. I know Sir of no fund for the payment of expresses nor any public Office upon which I can count but on which you may draw for that purpose. I am obliged to pay for the postage of all Letters, that do not come franked by some Person having authority, out of my private Pocket (this of yours comes exactly to one hundred Cents), and amounts to a considerable Sum in the Year. The necessity must be both urgent and evident to support the admission of such a Charge for the paying of them at the Treasury of the U.S. but it is there only, I believe, that it can be allowed. My last Letter has anticipated any reply that might have been necessary to your P. S. of the I have the honor to be with great Respect Sir-Your very hble Serv" P. S. on further reflection I have thought it best to extract the 18" paragraph also respecting the pay" of the Express and send it to the Secy of State. HONB'" JUDGE TURNER.  Copy to Judge Turner May 2' 1795 *— GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE [CHS: Wolcott Papers: ALS 89) MARIETTA May 4” 1795 SIR, By the last Mail from Cincinnati I received a Letter from Judge Turner, dated at Kaskaskia on the 24” of November 1794,” from which I have thought it necessary to trouble you with the following Extracts. “I have caused some seizures to be made under the Act of Congress of 1792,” and the Merchandize is held for adjudication. I cannot but contemplate that Law with some regret, as it is open to evasions and has, in some instances, been evaded before my Eyes. I feel the more regret,_because it virtually repeals the territorial Statute made to suppress illicit traffic, and which was every way competent to the purpose, tho' possibly—rather too severe. Under the present Law, the Indian Merchandize is not seizable, unless found in the indian Country—a very indefinite term. Besides as it cannot be supposed that our civil Officers are resident in the Indian Country, but on the contrary in towns and settlements, the first knowledge we usually have of the illicit Trader's arrival with Goods is from himself, on landing at some Town or Settlement to sell them to such Indians as may come in to trade. Others go directly into what I would term the Indian Country, that is not more than 10 or 15 Miles, perhaps, from the Settlements—there they send off runners to invite the Indians, who instantly crowd in to make their purchases. I fancy but few Sherifs could be found hardy enough to face such Traders thus surrounded by savages, who would without hesitation make the traders cause their own. I mean however to make the Experiment soon; but shall take care to have the Sherif supported by the Posse of his County. There have lately gone out from Kakokia to a point at no great distance, 14 or 15 Horses packed with indian merchandize, the property of british traders.” “Something must be done to give an effectual Check to this illicit traffic. I will state a Circumstance in proof of the necessity of it. Last Year, one Duquette, a Store keeper at Michilimackinac sent to Vincennes a Cargo of Indian Goods to the amount of 50 or 60,000 Livres. These Goods were there given away, not sold, to the Indians—and this was done by the express order of Du Quette for obvious purposes. Some appearance of a Sale was indeed kept up: The Clerk would tell an Indian, after handing to him Goods worth 50 or 60 Livres, to give such a Skin in return, perhaps a Fox or a Beaver Skin only. I am opined the whole returns for that Cargo did not exceed 5,000 Livres. du Quette is a Man of no fortune: Those Goods, then, were evidently the british Kings, and sent to destroy the Credit of our traders, and alienate the Affections of the Savages. This Year, the same Person had the audacity to send another Cargo towards Vincennes, but previous to its arrival at the Town, I dispatched an armed Barge with the Sherif on board, and that and another Cargo were intercepted 20 Miles below the Town, seized and brought up to it, where they now lie for adjudication.” “Since I am upon this Subject, give me leave, Sir, to suggest the propriety of a Law to declare Vincennes, Fort Massac, Kaskaskia and Cahokia Ports of Entry where Goods Wares and Merchandize coming from Canada and the british Ports, as well as from the spanish dominions should be subjected to an import.” Some millions worth of Livres are annually sent to those places,” and I conceive it impossible in the present state of things, to prevent totally the importation of Goods from the spanish side and Canada. The Communication is easy, and the People having no atlantic connexions, are in the old established habit of getting their supplies from those Quarters. By establishing Ports of Entry, then we shall gain that import here, which cannot be received at the Ports of the United States. Congress, I  think, would have no Objection to give up the Duties so received to the Territory—and thus we should be furnished with a fund sufficient for a while to answer the territorial necessities without continuing the Store Tax—a Tax which from its unequal operation, is generally, and purely, I think censured. Besides it brings but little money into the Treasury.” “Whether the proposed plan should or should not be agreeed to, there is one arrangement absolutely necessary, in either case to give effect to the Act of Congress as it stands—I mean armed Boats or Galliots. One ought to cruize from Cahokia up the Missisippi— another up the Illinois, and a third to be stationed at Fort Massac. This Measure would subject to inspection every Cargo bound for the Territory, whether spanish or british property, or the property of our own Citizens trading without License. It might also be made a Check upon the spanish supplies to the Cherokee and other hostile Indians. “The Express who carries this, may possibly want some accommodation towards his return. Should he proceed no farther than Cincinnati I have agreed to allow him Twenty five Dollars—but if to Philadelphia and back, then he is to receive one hundred Dollars. He will expect part payment at one place or the other, and for the remainder it will be necessary for me to draw on some public Officer, whom you will please to point out.” To those, Sir, except to the last, I have made no other reply than that they have been forwarded to you. But I will take the liberty to observe that, with a View to the extension of the Indian Trade, the Prairie de Chiennes is a place of considerable consequence, and to refer you to some Observations I had the honor to make to Mº Jefferson, in a Report of my proceedings in the illinois Country, in the year 1790, which is in your Office.f That Report,” Sir, embraces, if I have not forgotten, most or all of the Objects adverted to in the Judges Letter.—to the last Paragraph I thought it necessary to inform him that, I knew of no fund for the payment of expresses, nor any public Officer that I could point out, on whom he might draw for that purpose.—that I paid the postage of all Letters, (unless frank'd by some Person having authority) that came to me, out of my private pocket (and this from him had cost me exactly one hundred cents) and amounted to a considerable Sum in the Year;-and that the necessity of employing expresses must be both urgent and evident to procure the admission of a charge for them at the Treasury of the united States. f The Prairie du Chiennes is a place mentioned in that part of Judge Turners Letter which I have sent to the Secretary of War.” This, Sir, is a very extended Country, and from a variety of causes, would require the Eye and the Hand of the executive in every part of it.—but, as that is impossible at all times, you may perceive that Judge Turner seems inclined to take some of the trouble upon himself. I have however been obliged to remind him, upon another occasion, that the executive and judicial authority and duties are quite distinct, and, that it was my intention to keep them so—and that his office is neither inquisitorial nor executive. The above mentioned Letter contains also several complaints against the Secretary, and others, on which I have observed to him that, if they were intended as Complaints to be taken notice of officially, as they were unacompanied with any proof whereon to ground a prosecution I could do nothing with them;-and that, as to the Secretary, had they been attended with proofs, as he was not under my controle, it was to you, Sir, and not to me they should have been addressed; and farther that the territorial Statute, regulating trade with the Indians,” which possibly had been infringed, was not only virtually repealed by the Act of Congress but was and always had been a Nullity. These interferences, and the Confusion that ensues, create a great deal of trouble to me; and the Country on the Missisippi is now in that Situation that the presence of the Governor has become indispensible I must therefore make the Journey as soon as it is possible— God knows I am in a bad state for travelling. I have the honor to be with great Respect Your obedient Servant A. Sº CLAIR The Address of the Judge's Letter is somewhat singular, Arthur Sº Clair, Governor of the N. W.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE BRITISH MINISTER  DEPARTMENT OF STATE May 11. 1795. Mr HAMMOND, Minister Plenip” of his Britannic Majesty. SIR I have the honor of inclosing to you a copy of a letter from Edmund Burke,” vicar general of Upper Canada to the Wyandot   Indians of Sandusky. I entertain a confidence that it will be transmitted to Lord Dorchester, in order that he may act on the subject of it, as the existing state of things seems to require. His Lordship will immediately discern, that an attempt to dissuade those Indians from treating with the United States, is not conformable with the views, which he has professed.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT , WAR OFFICE May 16. 1795. SIR, The inclosed letter from Governor Sº Clair was received yesterday by post.” The proposed visit of the Chiefs of the Sioux, Puans &c. will be postponed of course, at least for one year—unless they come forward without an invitation or consent. Were it otherwise, I should doubt the expediency of the visit. All the means of attaching those numerous Indian nations to the United States it would seem to me better to have suspended until we get possessed of the Western posts: for they would naturally increase the efforts of the British to retain them in their interest, and perhaps prove a concealed motive for procrastinating the delivery of the posts. When that delivery takes place, they may be satisfied with a visit to the principal officer of the United States at Detroit or Michilimackanac; and then too the intercourse by trade may, advantageously commence. These ideas, as they have immediately occurred, are respectfully submitted to the President of the United States. TIMOTHY PICKERING  The Secy of War. May 16. 1795. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO TENCH COXE, The Secretary of State has the honor of inclosing to the Commissioner of the Revenue an extract from a letter of Gov" Sº Clair of the 5* Ultimo,” as to the extension of the Excise law. June 1. 1795 Extract of a letter from Gov" Sº Clair to the Secretary of State, dated Marietta May 5. 1795. The Commissioner of the Revenue has sent on to the Collector of this District Licenses for selling foreign distilled spirits and wines by retail. It is generally thought that the law forbidding the sale of those articles without license does not extend to this Territory—some persons will refuse to take license and the Collector will think himself obliged to prosecute them. Should the Collector be defeated, and I am persuaded he will be, the collection of the Revenue might be embarrassed in other instances where the law is clear. I gave him my advice, to state the difficulty to the Commissioner, and get his further instructions before he issued licenses. It arises from this circumstance that the excise law is expressly extended to the Territory and the license law is not; neither until that extension was any excise required here; and from a confidence in the general principle that the laws of the United States do not extend to either of the Territorial Districts unless they be named in them. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY (OSL: St. Clair Papers: C1) June 19th 1795 SIR I have attentively considered the question which you stated to me yesterday & have now the honor to transmit you my opinion upon it—I understand it to be the following, viz—Whether the Act laying duties on licenses for selling Wines & foreign distilled Spirituous Liquors by retail,” is to be considered as extending to and operating upon the Citizens resident in the Territory North West of the Ohio? There can be no doubt, that all the laws of Congress, unless local in their nature or limited in their terms, are, in their operation coextensive with the Territory of the United States, and obligatory upon every person therein, except independent Nations & Tribes of Indians residing on Indian lands—There is I conceive no ground for the opinion that the North Western & South Western Territories are not to be considered as comprehended in the general terms of a Law, and that they must be specially and particularly named in an Act of Congress in order to include them—Independent of the general principle which governs this case, it may be observed that the ordinance for their government explicitly directs that they shall be subject to all the acts and ordinances of the United States in Congress assembled—The contrary doctrine ought not to be admitted in any case, much less in that of an Act laying “duties, imposts or excises” which, by the express direction of the Constitution must be “uniform throughout the United States.”  The Act under consideration is not limited either in its terms or its nature to the several States. but extends to “every” person who shall deal in the selling of “Wines or foreign distilled Spirits,” &c, and must therefore operate throughout the United States wherever there are proper Organs for carrying it into execution—These are the Supervisors and Officers of Inspection who are in the manner directed in the Act authorized to issue the licences & collect the duty. The Act for collecting a revenue on distilled Spirits & Stills” certainly extended to every part of the United States; but as there was no authority for forming Districts and appointing the proper Officers except in the States, the Act could not be carried into execution in the North West & South West Territories. To remedy this defect, the President was authorized, by an Act passed on the same day with that under consideration to erect Districts within the Territories and to appoint Supervisors, &c, therein –Supervisors, when thus appointed immediately become the Organs for carrying not only that Act into execution but also the license Act: and I can perceive nothing in the latter that can with reason be interpreted into an intention to exempt the Citizens in one part of the United States from the payment of a duty which the Constitution directs should be imposed upon the whole. I have the honor to be with great Esteem Sir Your most obedient Servº - (Signed) Wºº BRADFORD THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.  Win Bradford June 19–1795 have lost no time in obtaining the opinion of the Attorney General on the point, a copy of which I have the Honour to enclose.” I have only to observe that as I perfectly concur with the opinion expressed by the Attorney General, the Officers of the Revenue will be instructed to enforce a Compliance with the Law, & that I count entirely upon the co-operation of the Magistracy & Officers of the District over which you preside. I have the honor to be With perfect respect Sir Your most Obed Servº OLIV: WOLCOTT Jr. THE GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY NORTHWEST OF THE OHIO.  Marietta. forwarded.” 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  CINCINNATI July 18 1795 SIR Two days ago I received the enclosed Letter from Henry Wanderburgh Esquire Judge of Probate for the County of Knox and the depositions accompanying it.” The Letter from a Person of the name of D Argi'lleupe was received some time in May and another from the same Person to Judge Symmes which was put into my hands by him. They contain heavy complaints against Judge Turner—but as in the last there was no request that it should go farther I contented myself with informing the Complainant that the Conduct of the Judge could not be enquired into but by the General Government: As Vanderburghs Letter, however, has put it upon me to transmit it to you, and I know how very ignorant the People of that Country in general are, and how little capable of seeking redress if they are injured, having always been accustomed to look up to a Command" as the proper Course and no farther, I thought it would not be improper to send those likewise. The Judge has been furnished with Copies of the first Letters and depositions, and I verbally informed him of that from D'Argilleupe. I am very sorry Sir to be obliged to trouble you so often with the Affairs of this Government which I certainly  should not, if I did not conceive myself called to it by way of official duty. With Sentiments of the greatest respect I have the honor to be Sir, Yº obedient Servant A* Sº CLAIR THE HONORABLE ED" RANDOLPH Secy of State  Copies of two Letters to the Secº of State dated July 18" and August 25* 1795. 
GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY (OSL: St. Clair Papers: C] CINCINNATI, July 24* 1795 SIR, The Letter you did me the honor to write on the 20" of June,” came to hand on the 20" instant, and I would have replied to it immediately, if the Post has not departed before the Letters he brought were delivered, and I am the more concerned that the opportunity was missed, as the opinion of the Attº General which my Letter of the 5 May to the Secº of State had occasioned you the trouble to take, was not enclosed, as you therein mention it to be—Your Letter contained no Enclosure whatever. The intimation Sir, given by me to the Secº of State (but which might, I suppose without a breach of propriety, have been addressed directly to you), that the Laws of the united States are not deemed to extend to either of the territorial Districts, I thought it my duty to give on that occasion because I supposed ill consequences might follow from a Question arising on a Revenue Law being decided in a Court of Law against the Revenue Officer or other, suing for the penalty attached to a breach. I did believe (and still do believe it) that with respect to the penalty for selling foreign distilled Spirits and Wine without license, it would happen. Whether it be an inadmissible pretention or not, that the territorial Districts are not bound by laws of the united States unless specially named, is not for me to determine—It is however no new pretension—and is a Doctrine which has long been held with respect to colonies—and those Districts are as yet no part of the united States but dependencies upon them, and have ever been considered in congress as colonies. The Duty laid on domestic distillation was never conceived to extend to them, or attempted to be collected in them under the general Law It was extended to them by a Supplementary Act," in which they are expressly named—a measure recommended by me to the late Secretary of the Treasury.” That very Act in which they are thus expressly named, and other revenue Laws, in which they are not named, came to be put in operation here at one and the same time. That Diversity alone would have been enough to have raised a Doubt if the matter had never before been thought of. But, Sir, I recollect a Conversation with Mr. Randolph, when Attorney General, on the Subject, when he expressed a sentiment similar to that which has been transmitted to you, from my Letter to him—He did also express a like Sentiment to Judge Turner in another conversation, as the judge has informed me and it likewise was the Opinion of Mr Jefferson, tho’ perhaps neither of those Gentlemen expressed themselves so strongly as in the Words used by me for obvious reasons, I chose to express Myself as strongly as I could. It is, Sir, of little Consequence what my own Opinion on this Subject may be, because, judicially, I can never have any thing to do with it, and executively, the Govern" has a right to command my cooperation with its measures, wherever that co-operation can take place—my disposition to do so, I trust is not doubted. The magistracy, Sir, by whom is meant, I suppose the judges of the different Courts, will, doubtless pay due regard to the opinion of the Attorney General—but, unless I intended in the present case to impress them, unfavorably, I should be unwilling to tell them that you count upon their co-operation, for I repeat it, Sir, Breaches of the Law in question are only punishable by Action of Law. The Revenue, Sir, that can possibly arise from the licenses in this Territory is a very trifle, and in most cases they have been purchased for this year already. But if it is to be enforced, the decision of one Action against the Person suing for the penalty puts an end to it, and will lay the Collector open to much vexation, for, I suppose, suits would be instituted against him to recover back the Money for the Licenses by most of those who have already paid it. At the next meeting of Congress if it was their intention the tax should be levied here, they can put it beyond a doubt by extending the Law [relating to foreign spirits and licenses] expressly [to the Territory,) as was done with respect to the duties on domestic distilled spirits.” I have &" OLIVER WOOLCOT.

GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  - CINCINNATI, Aug. 24", 1795 SIR. The Ordinance for the Government of this Territory requires that the Governor and Judges shall, from time to time, report to Congress the Laws by them adopted and published. Since the new organization of the General Government there has been no mode pointed out for those communicating directly with Congress, and they have conceived that the communication which went formerly through the Secretary of Congress must now go through the Secretary of State, and in consequence, you are troubled with two lists of the Laws, adopted at a session of the Legislature which closed this day,” one for the Senate and one for the House of representatives, which they request may be laid before them at the next meeting of Congress. Should they have mistaken the proper Channel, will you be pleased, Sir, to direct them to the right one, which will save a like trouble in future. The act of Congress entitled An act respecting the Government of the Territories, passed 1" May 1792 * directs that the Laws of the Territories, shall be printed under the direction of the Secretary of State, and two hundred copies to be delivered to the Governor to be distributed. The legislature have found that they can be printed here, which will not only put them sooner into the hands of the People, but diffuse the knowledge of them more generally, and have with these views contracted for printing those of the last Session; but, at the same time that called up an Expectation to the printer that he might possibly receive from the General Government the sum which printing 200 Copies would have cost in Philadelphia. Should the Measure meet your approbation, it will be very obliging if you will please to put it in train. The same Act directs the Secretary of State to provide proper Seals for the respective public Officers. When Mr. Jefferson was about that Business, the Recorders Office was some how omitted, and that Office is without a seal in all the counties which are at present four in  Number, and this session an Orphans Court has been erected, which will make the number of Seals wanted amount to eight, two for each County. With the Seals Mr. Jefferson forwarded Presses. The Device of all offices the same, and they differ only by the Inscription, and I have the liberty to inclose an impression of one of them.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT, WAR OFFICE Oct” 2. 1795. SIR Yesterday I was honoured with your letter of the 28" ult” In my letter of last Monday” I inclosed the copy of the treaty made by General Wayne and an extract of every thing relating to it from his letter of the 9th of August. The messenger who brought it was a discharged sergeant of dragoons, who did not leave Greenville till the 26th (or thereabout) and who brought letters to some people dated at Fort Washington on the 28"—In my letter of the 28" I mentioned what I recollected of the characters of the Chiefs who signed the treaty; and altho' a letter lately received from MF Chapin” mentions information received from Capt. Brant containing intimations that the tribes were not fully represented, yet if we obtain next year the western posts, I presume there will be no danger of a recommencement of hostilities. The news-papers have mentioned the desertion of four sailors from the British vessels at Detroit. Three of them have called upon me. Two I knew—they were sailors on board the Dunmore, in which the Commissioners passed Lake Erie in 1793.−They say the inhabitants in general at Detroit are well satisfied with the expected transfer of that place to the jurisdiction of the U. States. That Col" England (who commands at Detroit) has been examining the ground on the opposite side of the strait, and thought of erecting a post there about a mile & a half below that at Detroit. All their information showed that the inhabitants & troops in that country were in full expectation of a surrender of the posts according to the treaty. - M! Chapin in his letter of the 9th ult” mentions that Colº M*Kee had been down to Montreal; and that in future this was to be the place of his residence. This doubtless is a circumstance, which if true, will be favourable to the continuance of peace at the Westward.-The sailors told me that Simon Girty, the common interpreter for the Western Indians, in the pay of the British, had been dismissed. Gov" Simcoe has lately been in council with the Six Nations:” but according to M' Chapin's information, merely in a friendly way, without any particular object of business. I am with the highest respect, Sir, your most ob" serv" - TIMOTHY PICKERING THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES. P. S. The transportation of provisions from the Ohio to Greenville so prodigiously enhances the price, I shall by to-morrow's post write General Wayne, & propose his removing a considerable portion of the troops to the banks of the Ohio. The only difficulty that occurs to me is this—that it will oblige them to erect a new set of huts for the winter: but as they may probably place themselves in a forest, the convenience of getting fuel for the winter may perhaps counter balance the labour of hutting. Should he adopt the measure, he will leave such a force as he shall think necessary to reinforce any of the detached posts, & prevent the Indians entertaining any improper ideas that might lead to a violation of the peace.—I hope this suggestion will meet your approbation. The lateness of the season induces me to write immediately. T. P.  From The Secy of War 21 Oct 1795 
THE PRESIDENT TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  [October 7, 1795) TO—THE SECRETARY OF WAR SIR Your communications of the 2" Ins' have been duly received. General Wayne will, I hope & expect, leave the Garrisons in his advanced Posts sufficiently respectable.—In the present uncertainty of what may be the final result of the treaty with Great Britain, and from the intimations of Capt" Brant, we ought not in my opinion to Oeconomise at too Great a hazard;—nor build too much in the present moment, on the treaty of peace with the Western Indians.

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT 50  G.P.O. Novemr 16th 1795 FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT SIR Your Letters of the 8” and 20" of October * have been duly received, in the former you inform me that the Mail Boat No 3 had not arrived in time at Grahams Station for one week only, owing to a great fresh in the river; and in the latter you say that there are no Mails due now, and that the former regularity has taken place, from which if I had received no other representations I should conclude that the Mail had been carried except in one Instance, with great regularity to Kentucky, and the North Western territory. I have however received Letters from M* Graham and the Contractor M" Graham says that the irregularity complained of at Cincinnati is not the fault of the Contractor, but that it is occasioned by the Boat Nº. 3. which more frequently arrives on Saturday than on Thursday the proper day. The Contractor also informs me that he is detained at Grahams Station commonly until Saturday Noon which obliges him to hurry from Cincinnati. The Mail should be delivered on Thursday 10. a m under your regulations at Preston by the Boat N° 3, and the rider should agreeable to his Contract leave it on Friday Morning at 10 O Clock, but if he does not get the Mail before Saturday noon he cannot return before Friday which deranges the whole business. Upon your representations you were allowed to employ an other hand for Boat Nº. 3 as she had a greater distance to perform than the other Boats to place her upon a footing with them, this you assured me would ensure the greatest punctuality but, to put it beyond the reach of accident;-24 hours are allowed from the time stipulated for the arrival of that Boat at Grahams Station, before the Mail leaves it for Cincinnati. I am sorry to have occasion to observe that the representation you have made on this subject is not a candid one. The Mails down the Ohio are carried at a very great expence which is not an object if the Government as well as the Citizens can thereby ensure a regular communication with the Army and State of Kentucky and in my letter of the 18. of July I requested you to give me every information of failures on that route, and of the cause of them, and tho' it appears that they have been frequent, your Letter of the 8* Oct" is the only one I have received from you on that subject. I hope that the Mails under your direction in the Boats will be conducted with more regularity than they have been and that I shall hear of no more failures from that quarter MF Burral is sick who Settles the Accounts of the office I therefore cannot answer that part of your Letter which respects your accounts.” J.H 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO GEORGE GRAHAM &  [POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT November 16. 1795 GEORGE GRAHAM Esq." Your Letter of the 10 October * has been duly received and I thank you for the information it contains respecting the delays of the Mail in its transportation on the river My Letter to M*Dowel was written on a presumption that the Mail was regularly delivered to him on Friday morning conformably to his Schedule, this however I am sorry to find has not been the case, and if it had not been for your representations as well as those of the Contractor from Preston to Cincinnati I should  not have known to the contrary. Mº De Hebecourt was here in July when I was led to believe that an additional hand in Boat Nº. 3 would place her on a footing with the other Boats and ensure punctuality in the carriage of the Mail, as that Boat has a greater distance to perform than the others—This I readily consented to, and as Mº De Hebecourt had the direction of the Boats, I desired him to inform me of any failures, and the cause of them, as it was a matter of the greatest importance that there should be a regular communication preserved not only with the Army but also the State of Kentucky. My Letter to M' De Hebecourt was dated in July since which I have received two from him dated the 8” and 21* of the last month in the former he mentions only a single failure occasioned by a great fresh and in the other Letter he says that there is no Mail due now and all the former regularity has taken place I am much chagrined to find that the transportation of the Mail on the Ohio has been conducted so irregularly as from the representations of M* De Hebecourt I was confident that the additional hand in the Boat from Gallipolis to Preston with the delay of 24 hours between the arrival and departure of the Mail for cincinnati had secured punctuality in the carrying of it beyound the reach of common accidents You will find from Mº Burrals Letter to you of the 7" instant that he has desired you to draw on him for the Pay of the Contractor between Grahams Station and Cincinnati; however as you may be in want of some Money for present purposes I have forwarded by this post to the Post Master at Washington One Hundred and Eighty two Dollars and fifty two cents in Bank Post Bills—the fate of the last Bills remitted you has induced me to send them in this manner and I hope those will meet with a more safe conveyance than the others did. The Post Master will deliver them to your order— I have written by this Conveyance to M' De Hebecourt respecting the carriage of the Mails, and expect to hear of no more failures as in that quarter in future I hope it will be delivered in time to Mº Dowel Your Brother has not yet called but when he does I shall make him the payment you desired J H 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JOHN G. MCDOWEL, November 17. 1795. JOHN G. M*DOWEL I have received your Letter of the 3% of October in answer to mine of the 9" Septem’ ” and am satisfied that you have been obliged to leave Cincinnati, in a shorter time than is Stipulated in your Contract, from * Neither of these letters has been found. the delay in delivering the Mail at Preston by the Boat which carried it from Gallipolis to that place. My Letter was written on a presumption that the mail was regularly delivered at Grahams Station, as I had every assurance from M*. De Hebecourt, who conducts that part of the business, of the greatest punctuality, and I allowed him in July last to employ an additional hand in the Boat between Grahams Station and Gallipolis which he said would ensure it. It was certainly better for you to wait for the Mail from this place if you could not remain more than two or three hours at Cincinnati than to proceed without it. I have written to Mº De Hebecourt on this subject and I hope the business under his direction will in future be conducted with more regularity; at any rate I would not wish you to go without the mail but I expect you will not hereafter have to wait for it. I have enclosed one hundred and Eighty two Dollars and fifty cents to Mº Harris the Post Master at Washington who is directed to pay them to you. In future perhaps it may be convenient for M" Graham to draw on this office and his Draft shall be punctually paid. Money was sent for the purpose of paying you but M' Graham did not receive the Letter in which it was inclosed” J. H. GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE (OSL: St. Clair Papers: C 37] [January–1796] SIR On the 4” of May “last I informed the late Secretary of State that some confusion in the western Counties of this Territory occasioned, in some measure by some interferences of the Judicial with the executive authority which appeared to me to be improper would oblige me to visit that Country. Soon afterward I received information from General Wayne that after the Armistice had taken place, a number of Indians peaceably following their occupation of Hunting had been killed in that Country and about the same time I was informed of two Peotewatamies, in the Custody of the Sheriff, having been murdered there.” As Judge Turner was in that part of the Country when the Murder was perpetrated, I applied to him to be certified of the Circumstances and whether he had taken any, and what steps to bring the Offenders to Justice in answer to which I received the Letter marked N° 1." and his communication with the sheriff on that subject, upon which was issued a Proclamation" requiring them to be apprehended. The Legislature was at that time in session and it was not until the 29" of August that I was able to leave Cincinnati in company with Judge Symmes, a Court was held at Kaskaskia as soon as possible after his arrival there, where the most positive testimony as adduced to the Grand Jury against two Persons, inhabitants of the County of Sº Clair, that the Murder was committed by them, but no Bill was was found against them. The Court then adjourned to Cahokia, another Town in the same County when, at my request the matter was again brought before the Grand Jury in a very pathetic Charge from the Judge, and I directed the Persons prosecuting the public Pleas to send a Bill for Murder against the two Persons who had been before sworn to as the Perpetrators, but it was returned another was then sent up for Man slaughter which was returned in the same way and produced the Presentment marked N° 4–% From the Enquiries I made into the Affair of the Indians killed at their hunting-Camp, I found the Circumstances to be not only not blameable but laudable. The Nation they belonged to had been at open War, and committed great depredations and many Murders, and some of them very recently, in that Country, and neither the Indians nor the People had received any account of a Cessation of Hostilities having taken place, the People at least had not, and they had received Intelligence that the Settlement would be attacked by them the next morning, I am sorry however to add that, had the Affair been ever so criminal in its nature, it would have been, I believe, impossible to have brought the Actors to punishment. The difficulties that have occurred in cases of that Nature in various parts of the united States, as well as in this Territory, and the stain it fixes on the national Character has often led me to consider whether Justice could not be secured to the Indians by adding some sanction to the Law beyond what is usual between the Citizens, and it has occurred to me that, were a pretty heavy Pecuniary fine to be set upon the Murder of an Indian, and a proportional one for lesser Injuries, to be levied upon the Counties where the Offense was committed if the Offenders were not brought to Justice, it would probably have the Effect, for it is often seen that the Minds of Men little tinctured with Justice or humanity have a pretty strong sympathy with their Pockets, and I believe it to be a Subject within the province of the General Legislature. My Letter of the 4” May last” contained extracts from Letters of Judge Turner to me respecting some Services that had been made by his Authority, and complaints against some County officers particularly Mº Vanderburgh the Judge of Probate for the County of Knox,” and of my Answer to him on those Subjects of the 14* Decº last.” The Case against Goods that had been seized on the Wabash was dismissed by Judge Symmes and the Goods restored, and in the case of that against those that were seized on the Ohio, and sent to Kaskaskia, and there condemned and sold, a Writ of Error has been brought and the Condemnation will probably be reversed, and indeed if goods transporting on the navigable Rivers from one part of the Territory to the other are liable to seizure because thay may be goods usually vended to Indians, those rivers would be useless to the inhabitants and no Person who might venture to use them safe from the practice of common informers. It gives me pain, however that the Secretary of State should ever have been troubled with Complaints about County Officers, to the punishing their mal conduct the Court and the power of the Gov" are unquestionably competent, but as complaints also against the Judge were involved in them, it became necessary for me to send them forward. The Parties have made their respective representations, and were inclosed in my Letter of the 25 Aug'" and an official Copy of the transaction of Mº Vanderburgh in the Circuit Court complained of is contain" in Nº. 5" When I went to the Illinois Country in 1789 I was directed to enquire into and confirm in their Possessions and Titles the Ancient Inhabitants and others settled there on or before the Year 1783 * All the Titles that were presented were examined and so far as they were forwarded directed to be surveyed that specific confirmations might issue but on the late occasion, I found that many just claims had not been brought forward and as there was no limitation by Law as to the time of their being presented I conceived myself obliged to receive them and to direct the survey to be made as before—Grants of Land to a very considerable amount had been made by officers of the State of Virginia, and by the Courts of the Country after the Cession to the united States wholly unauthorized by Law—Those I conceive myself obliged to reject and accordingly did reject them in toto; but a Law of the united States has given some validity to those  grants where actual Improvement has followed, leaving it however discretionary with the Gov" to grant any quantity of Land not exceeding two hundred Acres to each holder of such Grant, and so in proportion to the nature of the Improvement. It became my Duty to take these grants into Consideration and I have received and registered all that were presented for the first time, as well as those that had been before rejected, and I have decided in no instance upon the quantity of Land to be granted in consequence of them—Improvement is not a very definite term and the discretion between one hundred Acres and four I was not very willing to use without some Rule—if less was given to some and more to others an accusation of partiality was a pretty certain consequence to one side, and if the whole quantity generally given of prodigality and disregard of the public Interests on the other side. Should the President Sir, think this a Matter of sufficient importance for legislative interference he will doubtless lay it before Congress—if it is not I hope I may be honored with his Instructions relative thereto. Nº 5 ° contains a list of those claims so far as they have appeared. The Donations to the Heads of Families in the Illinois Country have not yet been laid out, altho the Orders for that purpose were issued in 1790—the delay has been owing to several Causes, there was but one Person to be found in that Country who had the least acquaintance with Surveying "here—I was under the necessity of appointing him, but I believe he found himself inadequate to the task, and conscientiously deferred it—another was the poverty of the People— ruined as they have been by the changes of Governments they have been subjected to-by the Events of the Revolution wherein their property was seized, to a great amount, by the Officers of Virginia without any recompense—by the depredations of what was called the Wabash Regiment, self organized in that Country and which subsisted by Plunder and by the frequent innundations of the Mississippi—they were unwilling to part with any of their movable property to acquire lands which they could not cultivate, and were restrained from selling till five Years after Possession had been given them— they were in hopes too that as Congress had exonerated the Inhabitants of the Country on the Wabash from both those Conditions,” the same favour would be extended, to them, and therefore did not press for their being laid out. The Reason for so marked a Distinction between the Inhabitants of two different parts of the same Country, and in exactly similar Circumstances I could never comprehend, and I do hope that Congress will put them on the same footing, at any rate the five Years, should in my Opinion be computed from the time the Orders for surveying issued, for that there was an incapable person appointed was not the fault of the People, and they should not be injured either by that, or that the country did not afford one that was capable. Patents for the Donation Lands that have been alloted to the Heads of Families are much pressed for by those who are entitled to them. I had conceived that the Governor was fully authorized for that purpose by the Resolutions of Congress respecting them, and had prepared a form which I submitted to Mr Randolph when Attº General—He, however, was of Opinion that the Patents must issue from the President of the United States.” On this, Sir, I would beg leave to observe that the Records of the Surveys and the Documents are in the Territory—that a Certificate which would be attended with some charges must necessarily go from the Office of the Secretary here before a Patent could be obtained, from the Office of the Secretary of State— that after the Patent was obtained it must be brought back to the Territory and recorded in the County where the Land lies—and that the distance from Philadelphia or any other place where the Seat of the Government may be, and the Expense that attends any delay there are good Objections, such indeed as would render the Donation a mere illusion, No Order, however, has as yet been taken in the Case, that I know of, and People know not where to apply. Donations also of one hundred Acres have also been ordered to be given by the Gov' to those who were enrolled in the Militia on the first of Aug" * 1790 and not entitled to those of [MS. illegible] I have no difficulty as to those, because the Words given by the Govº I conceive a sufficient Authority. They have been ordered to be laid out, and a list of the Persons entitled is contained in Nº [blank] the paper, marked N° [blank],” is a Conveyance of two extensive Tracts of Land from the Piankishaws to Lord Dunmore and his associates, in which it is to be observed that there is an express acknowledgment that the Lands lying between those Tracts, beginning at the Point Coupé and running with the Wabash to the mouth of the White River, about twenty four leagues and running into the Country forty leagues on the east and thirty leagues on the west, is reserved for the Use of the Inhabitants of Sº Vincennes. That is the Tract the few People who have signed the Petition reclaim for the french Inhabitants. That the Land was actually relinquished by the Indians when a Post was first established at that Place I have no doubt, but it is evident the relinquishment was to the french government and not to the Inhabitants, because M” de Sº Vincens, the first Command" gave small  pieces of it to individuals immediately, on the express Condition that they should be improved in a year or be void. within the bounds of that Reservation are all the Lands that have been laid out, but a difficulty arises from the Treaty of Greenville 7" with respect to those not yet laid out in the Country on the Mississippi. To take that Treaty literally every foot of Land in the Country not in the actual Possession of some individual has been relinquished to the Indians, and should that construction prevail it is impossible for Congress to fulfill the Promise of Donation without violating it. The lands actually granted heretofore cover nearly the whole of the Mississippi Bottom between Kaskaskia and Cahokia, and many Grants have likewise been made for considerable portions of the high Lands, and claims are made in addition of an ancient improvement made by the Savages, not less than thirty Miles up the Kaskaskia. Those People can not be said in the strict sense of the Words to be in [MS. illegible: possession?] and some explanation it appears to me will be necessary—It was a part of my Instructions to enquire into the Claims of the Indians to Land and to extinguish them, but at that time I could not find that any Nation laid claim to them—The Cahokia Nation, reduced to four or five Families had abandoned the Country entirely—The Peorias amounting to about 100 had likewise abandoned it, and the Kaskaskia Tribe of about twenty Families laid claim to nothing but the Site of an old Village near Kaskaskia and about four thousand Acres of Land, which was confirmed to them by an Act of Congress. In all the Country from Kaskaskia to the Mouth of the Ohio, and across to the Wabash not one Indian resided, tho the Miamies, the Kickapoos, and the Oiatanons and perhaps some others occasionally hunted in it— and it is now a good deal frequented by the Shawanese and Delawares from the spanish side still, I am persuaded there are none of them have a just claim to those Lands, but when they learn, for the Country was the Peorias—and there will not be wanting People enough to inform them, that all the Lands except what was possessed on the 3" of Aug' last have been relinquished—Owners enough will certainly appear. The only places where the Donations could be laid agreeably to the Resolutions of Congress, and in the Country below the Kask* between the River and the high lands for the Heads of Families in that Settlement, in the low grounds above Cahokia for that Settlement and in the Mississippi Bottom as it is commonly called for those of the Prairie du Rocher & St. Phillips, if lands sufficient can be found there, which when the former appropriations are laid out I am persuaded there cannot—a power therefore to lay them out somewhere else should be given. The encroachments of the Spaniards in the Territory below the Ohio, I know the Govern' are apprised of—from some Depositions taken before me, and which were sent to Gen' Wayne,” they are establishing themselves in considerable force—it was thus described a large and strong Fort nearly compleated whereon about three hundred Men were constantly employed, thirty Pieces of Cannon already mounted, and six Galleys in the River. It was further deposed that several young Men, Inhabitants of this Territory passing down the Mississippi had been seized and forced to work upon the fortifications. Such conduct contrasted with General Gayosos Letter to me,” N° [blank] does not put the Spanish Character in a very fair point of View. Nº 8 ° is my Answer. An interview, however, I should have avoided if I had not been obliged to leave that part of the Country, because I was wholly unauthorized on any of the Objects he had in View, except preserving what Harmony now subsists, so long as the Government shall think it proper. The Commandant at St. Louis made likewise, a proposal that in case any of the Indians from our side of the River made incursions into the spanish Territory, or any of the Indians from the Spanish side into the Territory of the united States that both parties should be at liberty to pursue and annoy them, as they country [continue] in the Country of each other. There may be occasions when such an agreement might be useful, there are likewise very inconvenient consequences that might follow from it—at any rate it was beyond my powers, and I should suspect those of Mº Tardeau 7" likewise, but into that I did not enquire, I told him frankly I had no authority, but would certainly communicate his proposal to the President. It is a fact that the Kickapoos from our side do commit depredations on the Spaniards, and the Shawanese and others from their side upon us, and retire immediately to their respective sides of the Mississippi four Negroes belonging to a Gent" at Prairie du Rocher were killed by a party from thence a short time before my arrival there. What the Intentions of the Government, are with regard to the Sale of the Lands” in this Country I am entirely ignorant, but it is my duty to inform you Sir, that in my opinion, if they are not disposed of soon, such numbers of People will take possession of them, as may not easily be removed should that be thought necessary *—before I set out for the westward numbers of People from Kentucky had entered on the Lands of the U.S. to the westward of the Miami, and were making what are called improvements, I warned them to desist, without much effect, and it was all I could do, unless Actions had been brought against them as Trespassers which I had no Orders to do. The number however of those improvements had increased surprisingly before my return, so much so that, along the River, and a considerable distance inland the Country is covered with Hutts, and I am told the Case is the same in the Country above, quite up to the Penn" line. The State of Connecticut Sir, in consequence of the acceptance of the Cession of western Lands made to Congress was supposed to have gained an acknowledged right to the Soil of a large Tract of Country within the limits of the western Territory, but that Govem" at an early day seemed disposed to usurp the Jurisdiction over it, for they appointed the late Judge Parsons Surveyor for that Tract, and directed the manner in which it was to be divided “–some Letters passed between the Judge and myself on that occasion, and I also wrote to the executive of the State on the Subject, but received no Answer—a Copy of that Letter was sent to the Secy of State and may probably be on the files—my opinion was and still is, that before they proceeded to sell the Lands the consent of Congress should have been formally obtained—and that as to subdivisions of the Soil, beyond what was a mere consequence of ownership, it belonged to the executive of the Territory—I am informed by a Gentleman lately from that State, that the Legislature, in their last Session, passed a Law respecting the recording of Deeds within that Tract,” in direct opposition to the Ordinance for the Government of the Territory, which is a direct assumption of Jurisdiction. I am sorry to find I have troubled you with so long a Letter, but I have inserted nothing in it but what I supposed it proper and necessary you should be informed of. With much respect I have the honor &c" 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT  - GPO Jam V 6. 1796 FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT Esq." SIR I have received your Letters of the first and seventh Instant * from which I am now more and more convined of the impracticability of a regular transportation of the Mail on the Ohio during the Winter especially.— No season can be more favourable than the present for navigating that river, and if the boats cannot perform regularly at this time under the present arrangements I fear none can be made to effect that purpose.—I shall however I believe continue to have the Mail carried by that route for this winter, and to obviate the difficulty respecting the Boat Nº. 3. which you represent to be in very bad order, and not worth repairing, I have desired Major Craig to furnish you with a new one. I think it will be best to endeavor to secure a regular transportation of the Mail in the manner it has been hitherto conducted. Having a Mail in advance will only secure the Boat going without one—but it will add one week more to the time in which the carriage of it ought to be performed, which is already I think more than sufficiently long for the distance it is to be carried I am &c. J H. PS. In my letter of the 16" of Novem" " I mentioned to you that Mr Graham and the Contractor both informed me that the failures were occasioned by the boat N° 3 which more frequently arrived on Saturday than on Thursday and the Contractor is commonly detained at Grahams Station until Saturday Noon. I do not nor cannot suppose, that M* Graham and the Contractor have both wilfully misrepresented this business and I am now persuaded from your Letter of the 1* of Decem" that you know of no other failure than the one you have mentioned. I think it is most probable however that you have been imposed on by the Boat man—from your representations I am also convinced that you have used every means in your power to preserve a regular transportation of the Mail but I imagine the hands in the boat N° 3. have not exerted themselves to arrive at Gallipolis in time. In going down the river they can have no excuse for not arriving on Thursday. this is giving them three days (and going with a rapid Current) to perform one hundred & twenty five miles.” 
PETITION TO CONGRESS BY EBENEZER ZANE 87  [March 25, 1796] To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States. the petition of Ebenezer Zane of Wheeling on the Ohio River.— Your petitioner confident that the public as well as individuals would derive great advantage from the opining of a road through the Territory North West of the Ohio. from Wheeling to Sioto River, &  from thence to Limestone in the State of Kentucky, and also to Fort Washington, Hath given Himself trouble & incurred some expence, in exploring the rout and ascertaining the practicability of the undertaking. That from an actual view of the Ground He Has no Hesitation in saying that a good waggon Road may with facility be made between these places, & at a moderate expence. That the more fully to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed road, He Hath at his own expence employ'd a number of labourers, and Hath actually made considerable progress in marking and opening the same in such manner as to be passible to travellers on Horseback; and is determined to Have the same compleated in that way in its whole distance previous to the last of April next. But as the proposed road must cross the Muskingum, Hockhocking and Sioto Rivers, streams fordable only in dry seasons; it must be obvious that it cannot be used by travellers with certainty and Safety without the establishment of Ferries] upon these rivers. These establishments cannot now be made without the permission and aid of Congress the land being the property of the United States. Your petitioner therefore prays that Congress will permit and authorize Him to locate military Bounty Warrants upon as much land at each of the crossings of the above Rivers as may in their Judgment be sufficient to support the desired establishments which He will engage to Have made in due time, & will also defray all expences which may be incurred in surveying and laying off such lotts of land. Your petitioner Holds land warrants of the above description and only requests the priviledge of locating them in situations which may be pointed out by the necessity of the case, He asks no other compensation for his trouble, nor any reimbursement of his expences. In support of His application Your petitioner makes the following statement of some of the advantages to be expected from the proposed road: and in point of distance the saving must appear important. From Philadelphia to Fort Washington the distance by the rout commonly travelled is by computation . . . 980 miles—By the proposed rout. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 600. difference . . . . . . . . . 380. From Phil” to Frankfort in Kentucky the usual rout . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 900. miles By the proposed rout . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 600. difference . . . . . . . . . 300. In ditail From Frankfort to Limestone . . . . . . . . 70 miles From Limestone to Wheeling . . . . . . . . 190. From Wheeling to Phil" . . . . . . . . . . . 340. 600. The saving to the United States in the expence incurred for the transportation of the mail from Wheeling to Kentucky will also be considerable; at present fifteen men and their boats are employ'd in that Business at an expence not less than 4000 dollars p" Annum, liable at all times to great irregularity and delay from Floods, Ice, High winds &". Upon the proposed road the same mail may be carried for 1000 dollars or less making a clear saving to the General post office of 3000 doll” p." Annum and at the same time will be attended with greater regularity and dispatch. The advantages which must result to Travellers, particularly emigrants are too numerous to be detailed; and too obvious to require it—Your Petitioner submits His application to the wisdom & discretion of the National Legislature and doubts not but upon a candid examination his request will be deemed reasonable: & the undertaking He is engaged in admitted to be meritorious & deserving of encouragement.

AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE SALE OF LANDS NORTHWEST OF THE RIVER OHIO [May 18, 1796] An Act providing for the Sale of the lands of the United States, in the territory north-west of the river Ohio, and above the mouth of Kentucky river 90 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That a Surveyor General shall be appointed, whose duty it shall be to engage a sufficient  number of skilful surveyors, as his deputies, whom he shall cause, without delay, to survey and mark the unascertained outlines of the lands lying northwest of the river Ohio, and above the mouth of the river Kentucky, in which the titles of the Indian tribes have been extinguished, and to divide the same in the manner hereinafter directed; he shall have authority to frame regulations and instructions for the government of his deputies; to administer the necessary oaths, upon their appointments; and to remove them for negligence or misconduct in office.” Be it further enacted, That the part of the said lands, which has not been already conveyed by letters patent, or divided, in pursuance of an ordinance in Congress, passed on the twentieth of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty five,” or which has not been heretofore, and, during the present session of Congress, may not be, appropriated for satisfying military land bounties,” and for other purposes, shall be divided by north and south lines, run according to the true meridian, and by others crossing them at right angles, so as to form townships of six miles square, unless where the line of the late Indian purchase, or of tracts of land heretofore surveyed or patented, or the course of navigable rivers may render it impracticable; and then this rule shall be departed from, no further than such particular circumstances may require. The corners of the townships shall be marked with progressive numbers from the beginning; each distance of a mile between the said corners shall be also distinctly marked with marks different from those of the corners. One half of the said townships, taking them alternately, shall be subdivided into sections, containing, as nearly as may be, six hundred and forty acres each, by running through the same, each way, parallel lines, at the end of every two miles; and by marking a corner, on each of the said lines, at the end of every mile; the sections shall be numbered respectively, beginning with the number one, in the north east section, and proceeding west and east alternately, through the township, with progressive numbers, ’till the thirty sixth be completed.” And it shall be the duty of the deputy surveyors, respectively, to cause to be marked, on a tree near each corner made, as aforesaid, and within the section, the number of such section, and over it, the number of the township, within which, such section may be; and the said deputies shall carefully note, in their respective field-books, the names of the corner trees marked, and the numbers so made: The fractional parts of townships shall be divided into sections, in manner aforesaid, and the fractions of sections shall be annexed to, and sold with, the adjacent entire sections. All lines shall be plainly marked upon trees, and measured with chains containing two perches of sixteen feet and one half each, subdivided into twenty five equal links, and the chain shall be adjusted to a standard to be kept for that purpose. Every surveyor shall note in his field-book, the true situations of all mines, salt licks, salt springs and mill-seats, which shall come to his knowledge; all water-courses, over which, the line he runs shall pass; and also the quality of the lands: These field-books shall be returned to the Surveyor General, who shall therefrom cause a description of the whole lands surveyed, to be made out and transmitted to the officers, who may superintend the sales:–He shall also cause a fair plat to be made of the townships, and fractional parts of townships, contained in the said lands, describing the subdivisions thereof, and the marks of the corners. This plat shall be recorded in books to be kept for that purpose; a copy thereof shall be kept open at the Surveyor General's office, for public information; and other copies sent to the places of sale, and to the Secretary of the Treasury.” Be it further enacted, That a salt-spring lying upon a creek which empties into the Sciota river on the east side, together with as many contiguous sections as shall be equal to one township, and every other salt spring, which may be discovered, together with the section of one mile square which includes it, and also four sections at the center of every township, containing each one mile square, shall be reserved, for the future disposal of the United States: But there shall be no reservations, except for salt-springs, in fractional townships, where the fraction is less than three fourths of a township. Be it further enacted, That whenever seven ranges of townships shall have been surveyed below the Great Miami, or between the Sciota river and the Ohio company's purchase, or between the southern boundary of the Connecticut claims and the ranges already laid off, beginning upon the Ohio river and extending westwardly, and the plats thereof made and transmitted, in conformity to the provisions of this Act, the said sections of six hundred and forty acres (excluding those hereby reserved) shall be offered for sale, at public vendue, under the direction of the Governor or Secretary of the western territory, and the Surveyor-General; such of them as lie below the Great Miami shall be sold at Cincinnati; those of them which lie between the Sciota and the Ohio company's purchase, at Pittsburg; and those between the Connecticut claim and the seven ranges, at Pittsburg. And the townships remaining undivided shall be offered for sale, in the same manner, at the seat of government of the United States, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, in tracts of one quarter of a township, lying at the corners thereof, excluding the four central sections, and the other reservations before mentioned: Provided always, that no part of the lands directed by this Act to be offered for sale, shall be sold for less than two dollars per acre.” Be it further enacted, That the Secretary of the Treasury, after receiving the aforesaid plats, shall forthwith give notice, in one newspaper in each of the United States, and of the territories north west and south of the river Ohio, of the times of sale; ” which shall, in no case, be less than two months from the date of the notice; and the sales at the different places shall not commence, within less than one month of each other: And when the governor of the western territory, or Secretary of the Treasury, shall find it necessary to adjourn, or suspend the sales under their direction, respectively, for more than three days, at any one time, notice shall be given, in the public newspapers, of such suspension, and at what time, the sales will recommence. Be it further enacted, That immediately after the passing of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, in the manner herein before directed, advertise for sale, the lands remaining unsold in the seven ranges of townships, which were surveyed, in pursuance of an ordinance of Congress, passed the twentieth of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty five, including the lands drawn for the army, by the late Secretary of War, and also those heretofore sold, but not paid for; the townships, which, by the said ordinance, are directed to be sold entire, shall be offered for sale, at public vendue in Philadelphia, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, in quarter townships, reserving the four center sections, according to the directions of this Act. The townships, which, by the said ordinance, are directed to be sold in sections, shall be offered for sale, at public vendue, in Pittsburg, under the direction of the Governor * or Secretary of the western territory, and such person, as the President may specially appoint for that purpose,” by sections of one mile square each, reserving the four center sections, as aforesaid; and all fractional townships shall also be sold in sections, at Pittsburg, in the manner, and under the regulations provided by this Act; for the sale of fractional townships: Provided always, that nothing in this Act shall authorise the sale of those lots, which have been heretofore reserved in the townships already sold." Be it further enacted, That the highest bidder for any tract of land, sold by virtue of this Act, shall deposit, at the time of sale, one twentieth part of the amount of the purchase money; to be forfeited, if a moiety of the sum bid, including the said twentieth part, is not paid within thirty days, to the Treasurer of the United States, or to such person as shall be appointed by the President of the United States, to attend the places of sale for that purpose; and upon payment of a moiety of the purchase-money, within thirty days, the purchaser shall have one year's credit for the residue; and shall receive from the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Governor of the western territory, (as the case may be) a certificate describing the land sold, the sum paid on account, the balance remaining due, the time when such balance becomes payable; and that the whole land sold will be forfeited, if the said balance is not then paid; but that if it shall be duly discharged, the purchaser, or his assignee, or other legal representative, shall be entitled to a patent for the said lands: And on payment of the said balance to the Treasurer, within the specified time, and producing to the Secretary of State a receipt for the same, upon the aforesaid certificate, the President of the United States is hereby authorised to grant a patent for the lands to the said purchaser, his heirs or assigns: And all patents shall be countersigned by the Secretary of State, and recorded in his office. But if there should be a failure in any payment, the sale shall be void, all the money theretofore paid on account of the purchase shall be forfeited to the United States, and the lands thus sold shall be again disposed of, in the same manner as if a sale had never been made: Provided nevertheless, that should any purchaser make payment of the whole purchase money, at the time when the payment of the first moity is directed to be made, he shall be entitled to a deduction of ten per centum on the part, for which, a credit is hereby directed to be given and his patent shall be immediately issued.” Be it further enacted, That the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Governor of the territory north west of the river Ohio, shall, respectively, cause books to be kept, in which shall be regularly entered, an account of the dates of all the sales made, the situation and numbers of the lots sold, the price at which, each was struck off, the money deposited at the time of sale, and the dates of the certificates granted to the different purchasers. The Governor, or Secretary of the said territory shall, at every suspension or adjournment, for more than three days, of the sales under their direction, transmit to the Secretary of the Treasury, a copy of the said books, certified to have been duly examined and compared with the original. And all tracts sold under this Act shall be noted upon the general plat, after the certificate has been granted to the purchaser. And be it further enacted, That all navigable rivers, within the territory to be disposed of by virtue of this Act, shall be deemed to be, and  remain public highways: And that in all cases, where the opposite banks of any stream, not navigable, shall belong to different persons, the stream and the bed thereof shall become common to both. And be it further enacted, That the Surveyor General shall receive, for his compensation, two thousand dollars per annum; and that the President of the United States may fix the compensation of the Assistant-surveyors, chain-carriers and axe-men: Provided, that the whole expense of surveying and marking the lines, shall not exceed three dollars per mile, for every mile that shall be actually run or surveyed.” And be it further enacted, That the following fees shall be paid for the services to be done under this Act, to the Treasurer of the United States, or to the receiver in the western territory, as the case may be; for each certificate for a tract containing a quarter of a township, twenty dollars; for a certificate for a tract containing six hundred and forty acres, six dollars; and for each patent for a quarter of a township, twenty dollars; for a section of six hundred and forty acres, six dollars: And the said fees shall be accounted for by the receivers, respectively.” And be it further enacted, That the Surveyor General, Assistant- Surveyors, and chain-carriers shall, before they enter on the several duties to be performed under this Act, severally take an oath or affirmation, faithfully to perform the same; and the person, to be appointed to receive the money on sales in the western territory, before he shall receive any money under this Act, shall give bond with sufficient security, for the faithful discharge of his trust:" that, for receiving, safe-keeping, and conveying to the treasury, the money he may receive, he shall be entitled to a compensation to be hereafter fixed."

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE , PHILADELPHIA 26* may 1796 The Attorney General is of opinion that the President alone and without the advice of the Senate cannot appoint a Commissioner to hold or make a treaty with an Indian tribe for the purpose of purchasing and extinguishing their title to land within the limits of the United States. The 12" Section of the act to regulate trade with the indians passed the 19** instant, prohibits every person who is not employed under the authority of the United States from negotiating any such treaty or convention, directly or indirectly. The expression under the authority of the United States cannot mean any other thing than the Constitutional authority of the U. S. which it is considered cannot be bestowed on any person but by the President with the advice of the Senate.

By this Opportunity I take leave to make some few observations which arise in the apprehension of Censure for Delay in my official Communications which should have been made in Decº and June last and which it is still out of my power to transmit—for I am altogether ignorant of proceedings in the Executive Department of this Gover" from the Time of leaving to my return to the Territory no minutes Thereupon have ever been furnished either to me, or the Gentleman (by the Governours Consent) my Deputy."—They may have been sent in here since I left Philadelphia and miscarried—All these Circumstances I commit to you Sir in Confidence because I wish to stand well in your Opinion and feel pain at the possibility of being suspected of Negligence and Inattention in Office. I believe however that the proceedings of the Executive in the period before mentioned have not been very important—The Laws, though, should have been as early as possible submitted to Congress— my Deputy delayed them I presume for the event of the minutes before mentioned which put it out of his power to make his Communication complete–And since my Arrival, and the rising of Congress I have not believed it so very material but that I might take Time to effect the very many Corrections which are necessary in the printed Copies, One of which I have now the honour to Transmit,” And it is perfectly according with the rolls in my office I take Leave to present my best wishes for your Family and have the honour to be with most respectful esteem your obedient humble Serv W SARGENT  (private) Winthrop Sargent June 9. 1796. recº Aug' 5 anSW d 13th 12

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRESIDENT , DEPARTMENT OF STATE July 11. 1796. SIR, Agreeably to the intimation in your letter respecting a surveyor general,” I take the liberty to inclose the application of Israel Ludlow, with the certificates of recommendation which he has this morning delivered to me.” He is about twenty nine years of age, of a good person and agreeable manners. I have thought it proper on this occasion to inclose the applications of Mr John Hall ” & Joseph Ellicott,” whose names were formerly  mentioned as applicants. Mº Hall, I understand, is of a respectable family in Maryland; which I suppose has led Mº Murray to urge his appointment. He married a daughter of Dº Ewing, is upwards of thirty years old, and now I take it resides in Pennsylvania. His politics, I am assured are perfectly correct. Personally I know nothing of him.

I have the honor to inform you that the President of the United States has been pleased to designate you to perform, in conjunction with the Governor or Secretary of the North-Western Territory, the services mentioned in the Sixth Section of the enclosed Act of Congress, entitled “An Act providing for the sale of the lands of the United States in the Territory North west of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of Kentucky River.”” As soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, notice of the time when the lands will be sold will be published as directed by the Act; of which you will be duly informed.

You will observe that your compensation for this service is to depend upon a future provision to be made by the Legislature; which compensation will doubtless be equitably established and most probably with some reference to your appointment as Inspector of the Revenue.” I have to request that your determination may be notified by the Returning Post.

ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE, FORT MIAMIS UPON THE MIAMIS OF THE LAKE August 9th 1796 I take the Liberty my Dear Sir to address to you another merely private Letter although I can have nothing very interesting to communicate save that the Indians who are settled in the Vicinity of our Garrisons appear to enjoy very much of Contentment—some who were carried off by the Influence of M*Kee and Elliot are returning— their Cornfields look new and as whilst they are maturing they draw Rations from the public stores they give not themselves the trouble of hunting they have now all the happiness of supreme Indolence. The Traders who are here lead them sometimes into Excesses by the use of ardent Spirits—two Murders were the Consequence a few nights past but I trust regulations to prevent such abuse will speedily take effect— If I did not know that you have already recºvery particular Information of the Country in my ante* I should endeavour to describe it but I can not forbear to observe that notwithstanding the situations upon the Grand Glaize and miamis are very frequently high airy and endowed with springs of tolerable good water yet for a very long Time to come they must be subject to intermittents and the Fever and Ague, because from all those Northern rivers, in half or one mile and a half at most, the Country is flat sunken and full of putrid vegetable matter in the summer months— In my last Letter * to you Sir I felt hesitation about this Journey of Duty—The Fatigue (which has been very great) did not Influence me, but the Expense was alarming—The president it appears thought proper that an Addition should be made even to the Governour's Salary *—I trust it will not always be permitted for me to be the Sufferrer. I am really sorry that the Governour was not in the Territory to perform the Duties essential at and about Detroit—the Uncertainty of his Arrival and the pressing Application of Gen' Wayne with a Knowledge that our Laws &c" ought immediately upon Evacuation of the Country to be promulgated amongst the people, have induced me to come forward—in a few days I expect to be at Detroit—it will be proper I conceive that I visit Michilmackinac also, it being often a place of very great service for Traders, not less than than 2 or 3000 collected as I am told at certain Seasons though the actual residents are very few—Detroit and this place therefore must be of one County and perhaps I may think it proper to include in the same the head Waters of those rivers discharging into Lake Erie—” Though I have no Instructions upon the Subject yet ’tis probable I shall think proper to call upon all persons at Detroit and its Dependencies (by proclamation) to exhibit their Claims to Lands,” without however presuming to make any Decision whatever until the pleasures of Government be signified thereupon—At present it is my Expectation to return to Cincinnati ere Winter— I am Sir with very respectful Esteem your obedient humble Serv" WSARGENT . hoN* COL PICKERING By my Dairy I am from Cincinnati . . . . . . . . . . . 229 miles and it is said to be to the river raizin . . . . . . . . . . .
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT -  (Private) PHILADELPHIA Aug' 11. 1796 DEAR SIR, I am sorry that I delayed an answer to your private letter of the 20th of June.” You ask whether the possessing of Detroit &c. by our troops, will require you to proceed thither, for the establishment of the civil authority? and whether in such case you may expect a reimbursement of the expence of the journey?—It will not be proper for me to advise in what manner you should execute your office, with the duties of which you are better acquainted than I can be. At the same time it seems obvious, that by the authority of the United States, exercised by the proper organs, provision should be promptly made to extend to our new fellow citizens the protection and benefit of the laws of the Territory of which they are inhabitants. The operation of the municipal laws will doubtless be indispensable in those new districts. Until such provision shall be made, how will crimes be prevented or punished, or injury be redressed? What compensation would be made to Governor S Clair or to you, or to both, if you proceed to Detroit &c. to institute civil government in those new districts, I cannot undertake to determine: but should a compensation be made, I suspect it must be from the fund appropriated for the contingent charges of government, as for a case unprovided for by law. Yet to this it might be objected, that your salaries were received in full for all the services necessary to be performed by you as Governor and Secretary of the Territory; and hence a doubt might arise whether the Contingent fund could be touched in this case.—Since you wrote you will probably have seen that the President sent a message to the two houses of Congress,” stating the necessity of establishing civil government at Detroit &c. when possession should be obtained of the posts, and the expediency of a pecuniary provision for the expence which would attend the journey of the Governor & Secretary for that purpose.—This was done near the close of the session, upon the suggestion of Gen' Sº Clair. The House of Representatives (with whom any bill must have originated) I believe took no order upon it: at any rate, no provision was made. Under these circumstances, I feel myself embarrassed: I see the necessity of the service; I mean the erecting of a civil authority in the new districts; and yet, if for that purpose the presence of the Governor, or of the Secretary of the Territory, be indispensable, I cannot ensure to either an indemnity for the expence; I would, however, use my utmost endeavours to obtain it. But lest these should not succeed would advise that as little expense as possible should be incurred. A few days residence there might suffice to ascertain suitable characters for offices; and for the settlements above Detroit, probably satisfactory information may be there obtained of persons most proper to be appointed. And possibly this may be effected for even Detroit itself. I am affraid that all I have said will yield you little satisfaction. I wish it were in my power to be more decisive. With great respect & esteem I am, sir, your ob" serv" T. PICKERING. P. S. You kindly express your wishes relative to my son who was sick at your departure: he was a son particularly dear to me—& his death has inflicted the deeper wound. WINTHROP SARGENT Esq."

GENERAL ANTHONY WAYNE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY [CHS: Wolcott Papers: LS) Duplicate Head Quarters DETROIT 4 September 1796 SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29" of July,” requesting the most accurate information on a suite of Queries in order to facilitate a compliance with the instructions of the House of Representatives to report “a plan for the collection of duties, upon the River Mississippi, and on the northern boundary of the United States” ” In obediance to your requisition I have availed myself of the fullest information, collected from several of the first Merchants and traders belonging to the North West Company, Just arrived from Michillimackinac and other places of depot, on their route to Montreal and Quebec, as well as from those concerned in the trade on the Mississippi, Miamis, and this place, which in addition to other information and my own knowledge of the country posts and relative positions, I am free to hazard the following answers to your Queries in the order they were required from Nº 1 to 7 inclusive, which I trust will be found pretty authentic 1* On Lake Erie the principal trading place is Sandusky a very considerable part of the Detroit Indian trade, is carried on by the channel of the Miamis river and by the carrying place at Fort Wayne, down the waters of the Wabash; there are generally some traders on the river Huron & au Resen, all of which empty themselves into Lake Erie On Lake Huron the principal trading post is La guina on the west side of the Lake; there are some places of less consequence on the East side viz—Mateldass, Massissugue, & La Cloche; but with those I presume we have no concern On Lake Michigan La Bayl, S' Josephs & Chicago are the most considerable places of trade 2. I know of no places that promise greater advantage than those establishments which have been always maintained on those Lakes, and Waters connected with them, (by the French and British) with a few others which I shall mention in the following answer The British have lately made a military establishment on the Island of Sº Josephs in Lake Huron, distant from Michillimackinac about fifteen or twenty leagues 3" It appears to me that the Posts we are now in possession of viz Miamis, Detroit & Michillimackinac, with the addition of One at Sandusky, and another at Chicago (and which were contemplated In the Treaty of Greeneville) are very proper and suitable for posts of Entry, either to regulate Commerce, or enforce a due collection of duties All the Southern, or Mississippi trade, must of necessity pass from Canada by Lake Michigan, to which Michillimackinac is the key, but the door is rather too wide to close without the aid of a Gun or Guard boat, Michillimackinac being situate upon an Island nine miles from the main land, or place where Old Michillimackinac formerly stood Hence Chicago may be a necessary Auxiliary; I am of Opinion there is no necessity for extending the collection districts on the lakes beyond that point, unless it shou'd be deemed expedient at a future period to establish a Post at La Bayl at the bottom of Greene bay 4 The British have a right agreeably to the 3° Article of the Treaty “ of Commerce, to transport their Goods over all portages whatever without paying duties, but I apprehend, that it must have been intended, that such portages lead to or were, the usual & natural route to trading establishments not within the Territory of the United States The portages of that description, are S' Marys on the streight Joining Lake Superior, to that of Huron, and the Grand portage, on the North  west side of lake Superior, where it passes thro’ part of the Territory of the States; possibly the following carrying places leading to the Mississippi, were also intended, but of this you will Judge from the general tenor of the article From Lake Michigan there are two great water communications which lead to the Mississippi; One by the Illinois river, which is enter'd from the bottom of Lake Michigan by means of a portage called chicago (already mentioned), the other from La Bayl, at the bottom of Green bay—up the Fox river, from thence into the river Ouisconsing by a portage of about One mile; there are sundry trading posts upon all those rivers— 5 The Merchandize Sent from Canada to the Mississippi are generally transported by the Grand or Ottawa river & French river into Lake Huron by Canoes, thence into lake Michigan to the Mississippi, by either the One or the other of the communications mentioned in the 4* answer 6 No other Post than Michillimackinac appears necessary for the use of the Portages; but there may eventually several be necessary to prevent the introduction of Goods into the American Settlements without paying duty viz Buffalo Creek & Presque Isle on Lake Erie, at the confluence of the Illinois with the Mississippi, where we have a reservation of twelve miles square, at the mouth of the Kaskaskeas on the Mississippi, & at Fort Massac on the Ohio, large quantities of merchandize ascend the Mississippi from New Orleans and the Ohio to Post vincennes, and may also be introduced duty free into all the Settlements on the rivers emptying themselves into the Ohio above Massac, hence that will be a very essential Post of entry Here permit me to suggest that the Posts at the rapids of the Ohio, and at Fort Knox on the Wabash, might be abandoned and the Garrisons and stores transferred to the mouths of the Kaskaskias & Illinois rivers, which would complete the chain on the Mississippi, when the Posts now occupied by the Spaniards on the East side of that river, are possessed by the Troops of the United States agreeably to Treaty; particularly that of the Natches which ought to be a Post of entry as well as that at the Chickasaw Bluffs, unless the place of depot to be granted by the Spaniards will answer every purpose, which I rather think will not be the case 7 The principal trading Posts on the East side of the Mississippi, above the Ohio are the Cahokea & the Prairee de Chene, situate a few miles above the confluence of the Ouisconsing river with the Mississippi, where there is a considerable French Settlement and which serves as a kind of depot, and place of departure for a defusive trade This place (wou’d circumstances at present permit to extend so far up the Mississippi) naturally presents as a proper situation for a Military establishment, it is however said that a great part of the Mississippi trade is carried on by the British on the Spanish side of that river, & that there is no difficulty in obtaining from the Spanish Government a permit for that purpose, when thought necessary. Having now answer'd your several Queries agreeably to the best information I am possessed of, I shall forbear hazarding an Opinion “what degree of Competency are in with regard to supplying the Posts in their vicinity with Provision” until I have examined further But I should suppose from appearances that the Posts of Miamis Detroit & Michillimackinac, might be supplied with the article of Flour & perhaps some meat by the farmers on each side the river Detroit, and who appear very ready to part with their produce, at a very extravagant price I also have ground to believe that a Garrison at Kaskaskias, & probably at the mouth of the Illinois, cou’d be supplied in that quarter; at least a Colonel Sº Clair” (who has been very urgent for a Post at the Kaskaskias) assures me that the Troops can be supplied with provision on moderate terms; but I do not give or offer this as authentic I shall always & at all times be happy in Communicating to you any information which in my Judgement, may be useful or beneficial to our Common Country, whenever you may please to require it Interim I have the honor to be with Sentiments of the highest respect and esteem Your Most Obed" & very Hum. Serv" (signed) ANTY WAYNE THE HONBLE OLIVER WOLCOTT Esq." Secretary of the Treasury department of the U.S. vide SIR I have been under an error with respect to the boundary line between the United States and Spain until I examined the ratification of the Treaty which arrived by express last evening, I had always understood the boundary to be the beginning of the 31° degree of Latitude, but find it to be the northermost part of 31° or beginning of the 32°, hence the Natches will not be within the boundary of the United States—The mouth of the yazoo must therefore be the post of entry, in place of the Natches.” 5th September 1796
SECRETARY SARGENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  DETROIT, WAYNE COUNTY, AND TERRITORY NORTH WEST OF THE OHIO, September 20th, 1796. SIR:—I received the letters which your Excellency thought proper to write me upon the 15th * and 28th of August *—the latter yesterday and the former only this day. Collectively, Sir, I feel them to have been intended as a very severe reprimand. I had flattered myself that a most anxious desire to have benefited by your Excellency's matured judgment in the administration of government and studiously avoiding all agency therein, other than what I believed myself absolutely constrained to the performance of, might and would have shielded me from the implications of censure from your Excellency. Could I have divined, Sir, that you had intended being in the Territory at so early a period,” I should have spared myself the fatigue, hazard and expense of a journey from which I might have been exempted by your presence, but which (under existing circumstances in my occasional character of your official representative) I believed the Ordinance of Congress for our Government-–the President's Message to the Senate and House of Representatives,” and the pressing necessities of the people as represented to me by the Commander in Chief of the Army with his urgent application in print, all combined to make it indispensably incumbent upon me. The public seal, Sir, which you seem to have expected I should have left I supposed properly remained with me as Secretary; for though the new law, nor you, Excellency, under the same, have declared me the “keeper of the Seal,” yet such has heretofore been the territorial usage, and I cannot surmise that you could now wish to change the measure, but if I am deceived, you have only to signify your pleasure when we meet and no pecuniary considerations you will find can induce on my part the endeavour to contravene your Excellency's purposes. In all my public and private relation towards you, Sir, I have the pleasing consciousness of conducting myself in honour, delicacy, and ingenuously—therefore, not to have merited the shadow of censure. I have the most particular desire myself, Sir, and I take leave to communicate to your Excellency for very sufficient reasons, to solicit that the general government would take efficient measures to prevent that collision which you apprehend from my occasionally exercising the functions of the Governeur, and I could wish, Sir, that an application upon this subject might be made by your Excellency—as it respects me, it seems absolutely necessary. When I believed your Excellency considered Cincinnati as the most central and proper place for the seat of Government and deposit of the Public Records, where, upon returning to the Territory, you would resume your functions as Governeur, I could in safety for my rule admit the Acts of Congress requiring of me at certain times the discharge of your Excellency's duties—but (all pecuniary considerations . . . . . ), experience has now taught me that the law in conjunction with certain acts of the Territory may be so construed by wicked and designing men as too often to subject me to harrass and very great embarrassment; and you cannot now be ignorant, Sir, that several bills of indictment originated in the inferior Courts of Hamilton County are now pending against me for exercising the Governour's functions when I could not know your Excellency was within the Territory without a spirit of divination. I introduce not this, however, Sir, to draw forth the fine feelings of Friendship in my favour either for the present or to come, for if I err in duty towards you or the public, I ask not impunity. To accusation and trial, I have voluntarily subjected myself, but no man under Heaven has over me the right of reprimand. Your letters, Sir, which I have herein acknowledged were handed me upon my return from the Michilimakinac, where I had been to promulgate the Laws, etc., after having previously erected a new County and made most of the civic and military appointments therein, specific detail of which I would enclose but for a little cut in my hand that prevents more writing at present than is absolutely necessary. I shall, however, Sir, remain here, as you tell me you are going to Pittsburgh, so as to complete the necessary duties upon the part of the Gouverneur in . . . to give firm operation to the Laws of the Territory before my return to the Ohio which I trust will be effected in October. I have informed the Secretary of the Treasury that I should have obeyed his mandate * had not your Excellency's pleasure been signified for the execution thereof yourself. I have presumed, Sir, to address to you four letters * upon the subject of the minutes necessary for my official communications since I took the liberty of convening with you thereupon in Philadelphia, one of which only you acknowledge to have received and which it seems I have either miswrote or you have misread, for the papers I am deficient in are back as far as the division of St. Clair County, and instead of the “three weeks” since the report (of which they must be a part) becoming due, almost nine months have elapsed, in all which time, and a preceding five months, I have been obliged to keep the proceedings of the Executive upon loose sheets, in order to preserve the due regularity in the records, and must have to transcribe all the same therein so soon as you may be pleased to put it in my power, which I trust you will not delay, when I assure you it not only multiplies my writings twofold but a great deal hazards the same whilst they continue thus in loose sheets.” 
SECRETARY SARGENT TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  DETROIT, 30th of September, 1796. SIR:—I received your Excellency's letter of the 6th inst" day before yesterday. I deem myself peculiarly unfortunate in so much and so often incurring your disapprobation. “The records of the Territory” are indeed with me at Detroit, notwithstanding the hazard of transporting them so great a distance by land and water. I had believed, Sir, that I might have been enabled to have brought them up complete by communications to have been received from your Excellency and which I have been every day expecting. At present there are no entries therein since the August of 1795,” which in case of misfortune to myself might appear as a proof of negligence I do not allow myself in. If it had been otherwise and the records duly made, I should have believed it my duty to have locked them up, because they are especially in my keeping and for injury to them I am responsible. When I have left the Territory, I have been obliged to commit them, and myself also, in some degree; but whilst present I have in person generally attended your Excellency or the Legislature when there has been occasion to refer to them; and once or twice when indisposition has prevented my answering your demand myself and constrained me to commit them to your servant—although they have been sealed up and every precaution taken on my part to prevent accident or misfortune—it has been with extreme reluctance I have suffered them to be taken from my office, as I believe it to be altogether at my own peril. I have the honor to be respectfully, Your Excellency's Obedient Humble Servant, W. S. TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR. SECRETARY SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE [OHS: Sargent Papers:C) DETROIT NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY private 30th of Sept. 1796 DEAR SIR I am very much indebted for your private Letter of the 11th of August *-In extending Government to this Country General Wayne has a great Deal facilitated my movement by furnishing a Transport for the public papers &c". but for myself Servant &c". &c". you can readily Conceive I have necessarily been subjected to much contingent Expense—Government will however I trust increase my pay so as to embrace the same— I felt it Sir as a Truth, severe, as extraordinary (you will excuse me) whilst at michilimakinac, that the british Crown was actually then paying one Governour of the Island who is some where in England Scotland or Ireland—and the United States another, absent, the Lord knows where, at the same time that I was constrained without any, the smallest provision or Consideration to exercise the Functions and discharge all the Duties of the same: Lº Gov" Patric Sinclair receives pay as the Governour of the Island of Michilimakinac at this Day. It would afford me great pleasure Sir to give you Satisfaction by any Information from this Country—I press not the matter at present Sir because I know not to you the useful, and fear intruding upon your Time, but should any Considerations make it desirable I request you would command me. I can not avoid repeating in this private Letter Sir that I believe a priest amongst the Savages might be made very beneficial at 'makinac—The numbers of the Indians there I have given in my official remarks and here it may be proper to observe that there seems to be a great want of Equity in the Division of the annual bounty of the United States, which has however been agreed upon, to the red people and for which I see no remedy without an increase of that bounty:— whilst some Indians—the Kaskaskias for Example are receiving five hundred Dollars and actually do not (I know them personally) exceed thirty in men women and Children, living amongst, and constantly spunging upon the white people in the Village of their name—there are others whom the United States have adopted—the reverse of those, because they are respectable in numbers and in Arms—who do not in a general Division receive a pin's point *—'makinac is, and I am persuaded will be continued a place of great Consequence to the Fur and peltry Trade and of Course it might be good policy to shew some attention to the Indians in the Vicinity—Im—and Exports are from the best Information I have had nearly as valuable through this medium as by the Falls of St Mary's.- permit me to take you Sir for a moment to the “Grand portage” you pass through St Mary's to go to it, whence it is 500 miles Distant— here are Erected Buildings whence a very considerable Traffic to various Quarters is driven by men calling themselves the N West Company who by an immense capital have heretofore excluded all others *—apprehensive however that the enterprising Spirit of our Countrymen might require new Exertion on their part every Inch of Ground upon the portage has been enclosed that might admit of buildings stores &c" under various and frivilous pretences—all this Information is recº from such a Quarter that by me it is implicitly believed, but yet not Authority enough to make of it an official Communication—I have however directed one of the magistrates who has gone into that Country upon his own private business to make such observations as might enable him to report particularly and correctly to me—The “Grand portage” is it seems altogether within the U States Territory and from the Nature of the Country must be made use of not only as a portage but as a trading place also-you will excuse me Sir because 'tis from a good motive that I take Leave to suggest the propriety, importance of early ascertaining and determining this matter, as well as the Channels or Lines which divide the American and british possessions.—At this moment perhaps all such business might be easy and very amicably settled, but time and Circumstances which operate on all men might materially change public Characters— You will have no Doubt Sir that the british have erected a block house upon the “Isle de bois blanc’’ ” at the mouth of Detroit river and nearly opposite their New Fort—this is wrong, for though a vessel of Considerable Burthen may be brought up to the west of the Island yet the passage is dangerous, requires a fair Wind and has no where so much Water as to the East, the Channel which has been used time immemorial—and which is mentioned to you Sir to enforce my suggestions—  If any or all of those matters should eventually be to be decided upon by the Governour of the Territory, though a man of unparalleled Vigour and Exertion both of mind and body, the Interests of the United States and of Individuals would certainly suffer from Delay because there are important Concerns of the Inhabitants in many of the Counties equitably entitled to prior Consideration—For Example—the Land Claims of the people of Kaskaskias, Cahokia and other villages upon the Mississippi and Vincennes and other places upon the Aubashe:–at Vincennes and upon the Aubashe most of the business is completed—it commenced with me and has not I flatter myself been denied any attentions in my power to bestow— So soon as the affairs of the western Counties shall have been arranged, the people of Wayne County must be attended to-and all this will engross very much Time in which the Governours Duties will be very fast accumulating—for the period can not be far distant when the Territory (or Hamilton County for them) will claim their house of general Assembly * &c". &c".—upon this Subject I beg leave to observe Sir that the people of Hamilton and Washington Counties seem not ever to have been intended to live under the same Government—the latter are like unto our Fore Fathers and the former (generally) very licentious & too great a proportion, indolent and extremely debauched— The people of Wayne County—those upon the Aubashe and Mississippi are descendents of the Canadians, the ancient French—upright and docile in their Dispositions—equal in their mind and manners and tolerably contented and happy but not enough however industrious particularly upon the Mississippi and Aubashe—all those people would I am persuaded if left to their own Election infinitely prefer remaining a Colony of the United States And if they should at all comply with a requisition for Delegates to a general Assembly of the Territory, it would be with very great reluctance—The Expense and very great Fatigue of the Measure would no Doubt have its Influence and those to thinking men ought to be of very much Consideration— From Cincinnati (a probable place of meeting) to the Mississippi by the very shortest road will be three hundred miles and to Detroit an equal Distance; almost all the way a wilderness and a great proportion of the year impassable—yet notwithstanding all this I have no Doubt that the Ambition of a few men of the County first mentioned may and will make it the Governours Duty at a very early period to endeavour to convene a general Assembly and though probably without Effort yet very much to the Embarrassment of the people unless an early Division of the Territory shall take place—the people  of Wayne & the three Western Counties may be taken by the hand Sir and led to be every thing the United States would wish them. In the message of the President to the Senate and house of representatives upon the Subject of extending territorial Government to this place &c". he seems to believe it necessary that the Secretary as well as Governour should be present"—I hold the Opinions of the President in such supreme respect that Acquiescence is almost a national Consequence but the Records and public papers of Government that have been some years accumulating have now become voluminous or bulky and 'tis extreme inconvenient, as well as hazardous to them, to transport them from one Extreme of the Territory to another, and I had once very nearly lost them all upon the Mississippi—besides it appears to me that an office to which a County, and Individuals of a County occasionally may have cause of reference should be stationary somewhere—it has been removed from the Muskingum once, and where my Interests strongly drew me, because the Governour appeared to think Cincinnati a more proper place; and as my necessities absolutely oblige, and will oblige me to continue a Servant of the public I could not hesitate to fix it any where that should be thought proper even to my own Expense of the third office & dwelling house I should then have been constrained to erect within the Territory—but the travelling from County to County seems not to me necessary to Government or to be demanded of me—I could no Doubt be useful to the Governour as a private Secretary and this I have always been when In my power from Motives of Friendship: Governour & Secretary's Duties conjointly have all been performed by me and perhaps upon as important Demands as have or may be made within the Territory—I ask Sir, if it be not improper, your private Opinion upon this Subject.— I beg Leave Sir ere I close this very long private Letter to draw your early Attention to a Law of the Territory “for raising County rates & Levies” ” and another “subjecting Debtors to servitude” ”— they are a part of the Volume lately transmitted and may probably be reported upon by you early in the next Session of Congress—May not the first too much check industry and Improvement and does not the latter militate with the first part of the 6th Article of Compact published at the Close of the Ordinance of Congress for our Government July the 13th 1787—Viz: “There shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary Servitude in the said Territory otherwise than in punishment of Crimes whereof the party Shall have been duly convicted”—As I believe it my Duty Sir to observe to you every matter which may be anywise useful to  the United States I can not but suggest an Apprehension of the british Indian Department in this Quarter–McKee who has perhaps powerful motives to continue in the Savage mind an Enmity towards our Government neglects not I am persuaded any opportunity for the purpose; on concluding a late purchase of Lands from them he says— “my Children” ” This Land is bought of you, not for our use but for your own, that when you are tired of your Step Father you may have a place to set down upon”—“it is true your Step Father has taken you by the hand but I am afraid he will deceive you”—“He formerly took your Brothers in Georgia by the Hand but he has lately killed ten of them and is now going there to kill more”— This Information I have from a Mr May” one of our Magistrates who had it from an Indian that was present— The English people here Sir are still endeavouring to extend their Claims to the Indian Lands—they seem a little apprehensive of purchase and therefore receive the same in presents which the chiefs are prevailed upon to declare in Counsel are free and voluntary Gifts and to ask their Fathers the United States to confirm:-I am, in order to prevent this and for other purposes, printing the Law regulating Indian Intercourse” &c". which I trust may be attended with Statutory Effects— With sincere wishes for the happiness of yourself and Family Sir I have the honour to be most respectfully your obedient humble Servant W SARGENT HONble TIMOTHY PICKERING  Secretary of State private 30th Sep 1796 
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO JOHN NEVILLE  tº Richard Pollard, Detroit merchant, 1784; sheriff, western district of Canada, 1792; judge of probate and register of Essex County, Canada; Episcopal minister  Pittsburgh on sales of the lots or sections in the seven ranges of, Townships, surveyed in pursuance of an Ordinance of Congress, passed on the 20" of May 1785?”—it has become my duty to furnish instructions for conducting the said sales in a regular manner, and for rendering the Accounts thereof according to law—For the sake of perspicuity these instructions will point out, not only what I conceive to be your duty, but also that of the Superintendants of the sales. The lots to be sold are those contained in a printed schedule or list enclosed signed by Me and with the seal of the Treasury annexed 74— It is necessary that all sales and entries in the accounts should be made with reference to this schedule, as one or two errors of the press have been discovered in those formerly transmitted. You are to cause a Book to be prepared, ruled according to the form marked (D) which is to contain a record of all the sales.” When a sale has been made, you are to receive of the sum bidden one twentieth part in money,” and thereupon to issue a certificate according to the form marked, A–Blank Certificates of this form will be transmitted which are to be carefully and accurately numbered in progressive order and filled up as sales are made by a good Clerk;- within the marginal checks, the principal particulars of the Certificates are to be inserted. When a Certificate for a Deposit agreeably to the form A has been issued, a record thereof is to be made in the Book, D–In recording Certificates of the form A–only the first eleven columns of the Book D will be used.—The example given of a supposed sale to James Frazier will illustrate what is to be done in this case.—If a sum sufficient to complete a moiety of the purchase money is not paid within thirty days after the sale the deposit is to be considered as forfeited to the public and the sale void—The sum deposited is then to be extended into the twenty first column of the Book, D, agreeably to the example given in the case of the supposed sale to James Frazier–If at the end of thirty days a sum sufficient to complete a moiety of the purchase money shall be paid, a Certificate is to be issued according to the form, B, to be signed by the Superintendants of the sales—To save unnecessary trouble and expence it will be best that these Certificates of which blanks will be transmitted should be filled up under your direction. On issuing a Certificate according to the form B, a record is to be made in the Book D, from the twelfth to the twenty first column inclusive;—the entries relative to the supposed sale of John Gibson, will shew what is to be done in this case. If within thirty days from the time of a sale the Purchaser of a lot or section shall elect to make payment of the whole purchase money, he will be entitled to a deduction of ten p Centum on one moiety; and on payment thereof is to receive a Certificate, agreeably to the form, C, to be signed by the Superintendants of the sales.—The record to be made in the Book D in this case is illustrated by the entries relative to a supposed sale to John Wilkins, from the fifteenth to the twenty first Columns of the said form, D. On issuing the Certificates B or C, the Deposit Certificates of the form, A, are to be taken up and cancelled. It is conceived to be most proper that the cancelled Certificates A should remain in the hands of the Superintendants of the sales. Special care is to be taken to preserve accurate marginal entries respecting all Certificates which may be issued. It is recommended to the Superintendants of the sales to sign no Certificates of the form B & C, without previously examining the records thereof in the Book D. As the Patents to be hereafter issued by the Secretary of State will be governed by the Certificates B & C, attention must be given to a proper description of the Range, Township and Section of the lands which may be sold. The form E is that of an account to be kept of the fees demandable under the eleventh Section of the Act directing sales;–these fees become payable, on issuing the Certificates B or C, the second Column refers to the number of the Certificates on issuing which the fees aCCrue. When the sales have been completed, or if they should be suspended for more than three days, the Superintendants of the sales are to examine the records in the Book D, and to certify the same, and are to cause a copy of the said Book with their Certificate to be transmitted to this office. With the Copy of the Book D, and the account of fees received E you are to transmit an account current according to the form F, in which will be credited agreeably to the principles proposed, all the monies which you shall have received. I shall expect to receive a weekly statement of the sums which may be received as also information of the probable future progress of the sales; the sums from time to time so received & exhibited in your weekly returns, will be held by you subject to the drafts of the Treasurer.

TERRITORY Super" Gent” I shall transmit by this Post a letter of instructions to John Nevill Esquire who has been appointed to receive the money which may be paid on sales of the seven Ranges of Townships proposed to be made at Pittsburgh—In this letter I have taken the liberty to make certain suggestions relative to the mode in which I conceive it will be proper that your duties should be executed—to this letter I have therefore the honor to refer you. You will I doubt not discern that my motive in not addressing a particular letter to you, arose from the difficulty of perspicuously detailing the separate duties of the Receiver of the monies, from those of the Superintendants of the sales, and because the instructions principally relate to details which ought properly to be executed under his inspection and for which he is to be responsible. There is one point however which I think proper to communicate to you directly, and which ought to be well understood when the sales are made. I find that in the surveys made under the Ordinance of May 20" 1785 only the exterior lines of the Townships were surveyed, the interior Divisions into Sections have never been actually run. All therefore that can be known with certainty from the surveys in this Office is that the whole quantity of land in a given Township or fractional part of a Township amounts to a number of acres as expressed in the printed Schedules—The quantities in fractional Sections of fractional Townships as stated have therefore no other certainty than was to be obtained by a calculation according to a geometrical Scale.—This, you are sensible cannot be entirely accurate; if it shall be hereafter found that the meanders of the Ohio, have not been accurately laid down, the basis upon which the calculations have been made, will be subverted.” I conceive that this fact ought to be known in order to avoid future complaints of deception by the Public. The mode in which the information shall be given is submitted to your discretion, though, in my opinion it will be proper to say, that the quantity of land in the fractional Townships are stated in the schedules from the original surveys deposited in the Treasury, but that the quantities in the fractional sections are no otherwise known than by a calculation by a geometrical scale which has been made with as much accuracy as was possible.” I have &c. &c.

The small Patent to M'. Kemberly * ought to have been noted.

Pickering delivered me your Letter to him of the 11" of June,” on the subject of the Ohio Mail, and I am much obliged to him for thus introducing to my acquaintance a Gentlemen of your Character and Information. For some time I had determined to drop the route down the Ohio and resume that through the Wilderness as less expensive and more certain, for the many failures which happened during the course of last Winter in a great measure interrupted the intercourse with the North Western Territory and the State of Kentucky and tended to destroy all confidence in that Mail—Some obstacles however have occurred to resuming the route through the Wilderness which determined me to make a further trial of that down the Ohio especially as I had an opportunity of placing the Contract in the hands of M* Greene * in whom I have the most perfect confidence. Mr Greene is of opinion that light and safe Boats may be constructed to be navigated with fewer hands and to much greater advantage in Stemming the Current of the Ohio than those hitherto employed which he represents as quite unfit for that service. I have agreed to allow him an additional Boat and he to provide four new ones at the public expence on the construction which he thinks will answer best. The Mails should be carried in Portmanteaus as in case of accident they can be more conveniently removed and I presume the Boats will be large enough to admit of boxes fixed in such a manner as will secure the Mails from water.—if boxes are made, to render them perfectly secure, it will be necessary to have them covered with oil cloth. I now enclose you a blank Bond, Oaths, and Contract and I have to request the favor of you to see them executed by M. Greene with proper security. The Contract is only to continue for a year at the expiration of which time I think it is probable that the Mail will be carried on Mº Zanes route from Wheeling to Limestone,” this road I am told is already opened and has been passed by some persons who represent the distance to be about Two Hundred Miles, in this event Marietta may be accomodated with a cross Post to connect with the route from Wheeling to Limestone I shall thank you for any information you can give me respecting this road. I have been free in writing to you respecting this business as I know how much you are interested in having a Mail regularly carried on the Ohio as I cannot write particularly by this Post to M* Greene. I will thank you to shew him the Contents of this Letter.” J H
ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE , CINCINNATI 20th of January 1797– DEAR SIR Some time last Spring and immediately upon my arrival in this Territory I made communication if I mistake not of the very general Intrusions upon the Lands of the United States"—the Steps I had formerly taken [to] prevent such measures And expressed that, without special Instructions from the General Government I should believe any further Interference of mine improper—my reasons, perhaps, were specially detailed;—Since then, people from various parts are flocking in, and principally establish themselves below the great Miami. I suppose in numbers, rising one thousand—some of them expect, I am told, to obtain a pre-emption farm settlement, others, and the greater part are induced by its remoteness from the magistrates of Knox County; of wº it is a part;-to be free as the Natives. It is the wish of many here that I should annex it to Hamilton County—but might not this be construed into countinancing their Settlements?—I fear myself unpleasantly situated in this Business and also in regard to some Lands said by Judge Symmes to have been purchased by him—but as yet I have made no appointments amongst them— I am inclined to think that Government—the General Govern' I mean, might once very easily have prevented this squatting—The Consequences now must be considerably injurious and are every Day becoming more so in their Aspect, and if it shall be determined to remove the Settlers, in many Cases it must be extreme distressing:—I trust Sir these private Observations will not be displeasing—they are well meant. May I hope Sir ere the President abdicates that he will endeavour to do for me one Act of Justice—he believed, it seems provision necessary to the Secretary as well as Governour to perform certain Duties; done by the Secretary—the house will not make it—to the Contingent Fund alone then can he look—I remember 'twas the Opinion of Col. Peck When I was soliciting Congress for Compensation whilst I had been discharging Governours Duties that it ought to be made to me from that Fund but the President can want no Opinion if he thinks the measure proper, and if he does not I must continue to suffer.” I have the honour to be Sir with most respectful Esteem—Your obedient humble Serv" W SARGENT HON ble COL PICKERING—  Winthrop Sargent Jan’ 20. 1797 
RUFUS PUTNAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  MARIETTA January 25" 1797. OLIVER WOLCOTT jº Esquire Secretary of the Treasury SIR, Having been appointed Surveyor General by the President of the United States,” on the fifth of November, I wrote the Secretary of State,” requesting to be informed in several matters which I conceived material, relating to prosecuting the Surveys, in answer to which he informed me that, “conceiving the business to pertain properly to the Department of the Treasury he had sent my letter to you,” I have waited more than a month expecting to be honoured with your commands, but receiving no information from you, & apprehending that my letter, above mentioned, may be misplaced or forgotten—I take the liberty to repeat to you the substance of that letter, as it respects the execution of the Surveys, (Viz')—that I am ready to enter on the business as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made;—But before I proceed to engage with any Deputy Surveyor I expect to be instructed in regard to the compensation to be allowed to assistant Surveyors, Chain Carriers & Axe Men agreeably to the 10* Section of the act intitled “An Act providing for the sale of Lands &C.”—I wish also to know when and in what manner they are to be paid; whether there is any appropriation of monies for defraying the expence & if there is, in what manner it is to be drawn out—also whether Government will make any advances for the purpose of laying in provisions in the proper season of procuring them (to be furnished to the Surveyors who execute the work to be accounted for by them as part pay for their services) I wish also to know what number of Townships or Miles a Deputy Surveyor shall be obliged to run before he shall have a right to claim payment for his services—These circumstances I not only wish, but conceive it is necessary I should be ascertained of, that I may not be liable to enter into contracts, which it will not be in my power to perform—And as the Laws contemplate the Survey of all the vacant unappropriated Lands lying North West of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of the River Kentucky in which the title of the Indian Tribes have been extinguished, I beg leave to suggest, that in my opinion it will be proper to have the boundary lines between these lands & the present Indian claims ascertained as soon as may be, to prevent all danger of our encroaching on the Indian lands in running the several tracts into Townships & because any location near them before the boundary lines are surveyed would probably occasion jealousies in the minds of the Indians which might prove of very bad consequences—I also wish to know if it is the expectation of Government that the running these boundary lines is to be under my directions or whether a special Commission is to be issued to some person or persons, for that purpose; If it is to be under my superintendency, as the first section of the act providing for the sale of the lands &c. &c. appears to express, I wish to know if any special provision is made for defraying the expence, if not I pray whether such provision ought not to be made, because I conceive in order to give satisfaction, it will be proper to invite a number of Indian Chiefs to be present, & because that in my opinion these lines ought to be made very conspicuous by opening a Westige of some feet in width which would be attended with considerable additional expence, beyond the Survey of any other lines, & cannot be executed at the common allowance p" Mile—I also wish to be informed what part of the other survey, it is the wish of Government should be first attended to.—I hope Sir, you will be so good as to resolve me in these several queries as soon as may be, as the Season is fast approaching when the Surveys ought to commence, and I must repeat the observation, that I cannot with propriety enter into any Contract for executing the business, until an appropriation of money is made by Government for paying the expence, which I do not find to be the case, by any act of Congress that has come to my knowledge,” and besides, unless that some special provision is made for the expence of ascertaining the boundary lines between the present Indian Claims & the lands in which the Indian title is extinguished I much doubt if any Surveyor can be found to undertake the business.” I have the honour &c &c RUFUS PUTNAM tion of the act entitled “An Act regulating the grants of Land appropriated for Military services, and for the Society of the United Brethren for propagating the Gospel amongst the Heathen.” " Eacd 
PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY  [February 20, 1797] To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.” The humble Petition of the Inhabitants of the Illinois Respectfully sheweth. That by Resolves of Congress of 20° June 8 & 29* August 1788,” since ratified by Laws of the United States," a Donation of 400-Acres of land was made to each head of a family in the Illinois on or before the year 1783; which lands were therein directed to be laid off in form of a Pallologram adjadacent to the four respective villages therein— That the Lands so directed to be laid off for satisfying the said Donations, as well as the most part of the lands in the Mississipi Bottom, are private property, by virtue of antient Deeds and by Laws of the United States confirmed to the respective Proprietors. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that they may be permitted to lay out the said Donation Lands in Tracts on the waters of Kaskaskia Creek, which runs in the Vicinity of the Settlements; And that his Excellency the Governor of the Territory be authorized to have the same surveyed and to issue out patents accordingly—And your Petitioners shall ever pray &c on Behalf of the Inhabitants J EDGAR Wm MORRISON Dated 20th February 1797.

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO RUFUS PUTNAM  TREASURY DEPARTMENT March 14th 1797 RUFUS PUTNAM Esq." Surveyor General SIR Your Letter of January 25" " was seasonably received, but as no measures could be taken by the Executive until an appropriation of money had been made, and as this measure was not adopted by Congress until the 3" instant,” it has been out of my power to answer your enquiries before this time. 1* The President of the United States directs, that it be submitted to your discretion to contract for the compensation to be allowed to the Assistant Surveyors, Chain Carriers & Axe men, on the best terms which may be practicable;—provided that the whole expence of surveying & marking the lines do not exceed three dollars p" Mile for every Mile that shall be actually run & marked.”— 2" The purchase of provisions on public account for the use of the Surveyors and their Assistants, does not appear to be expedient; as this Measure would tend to complicate the accounts of your Department—reasonable advances of money will however be made directly to yourself from the Treasury, for which you will be held accountable;—these monies may at your discretion be expended, in purchasing, provisions for the Surveyors to be accounted for by them in part payment for their services:—but no credits will be allowed to you, except for services performed according to the Law—When advances are made, it will therefore be proper & necessary that you should be Satisfied with the security therefor and that the same will be duly accounted for.— 3* Your accounts are to be rendered to the Treasury for settlement, Quarter yearly, closed to the last days, of March, June, September & December."—In these accounts all monies advanced from the Treasury to you, will be credited—the debits will consist of your Salary, & charges for services performed by the Surveyors & their Assistants pursuant to Contracts to be made with you—If monies are advanced On account, a list thereof is to be transmitted, and the amount thereof is to be stated as a component part of the balance to be accounted for by you in a subsequent settlement.  Copies of all contracts made by you with the Assistant Surveyors or other persons, are from time to time to be transmitted to this Department, as soon as the same are completed.” 5* The unascertained outlines of the Lands lying North West of the River Ohio, & above the mouth of the River Kentucky, in which the titles of the Indian Tribes have been extinguished by the Treaty with General Wayne on the 3° of August 1795,” are to be run under your direction—You will inform General Wilkinson when & where you are ready to commence running the line, who will have orders from the Secretary of War, to furnish an escort, & who will take measures for convening such number of Indians as shall be thought proper; the expences of the escort & Indians will be defrayed by the Department of War.—Unless special inconveniences & extra expence render the measure inexpedient, you will in the first place ascertain and mark the North boundary of the Tract appropriated for satisfying Military Warrants, lying between the Scioto and the Tuscororas branch of the Muskingum River. 6" Your special attention to the completion of the surveys of the Lands appropriated for satisfying military Warrants by the Act of June 1* 1796, is requested. 7th You will be pleased to take measures for the survey of the three Tracts, of Shoenbrun, Gnaden hutten & Salem appropriated for the Society of the United Brethren by a Resolution of the late Congress, and an act of Congress of the 1* of June 1796. The Agents of the Society will proceed from Bethlehem in about three Weeks. 8* You will make arrangements for completing as soon as may be, the surveys of seven Ranges of Townships, below the Great Miami of the Ohio & above the mouth of the Kentucky River, also between the Scioto River & the lands purchased by the Ohio Company.”—Also between the Southern boundary of the Connecticut Claims & the seven Ranges of Townships, which were surveyed in pursuance of an Ordinance of Congress under the late confederation, passed on the 20" of May 1785–In commencing surveys within one or all of the several Tracts abovementioned, you will be governed by considerations having reference to Oeconomy, the natural course of settlement the comparative fertility of the different Tracts, and the probability of speedy sales on account of the United States: Of the measures which you may adopt & your reasons, therefore you will be pleased to keep me duly advised.” 9* Plats of each Township are to be neatly & accurately protracted according to Law on durable paper, by a scale of two inches to a mile which are to be recorded in books to be kept in your Office—Copies of the plats & field notes are to be transmitted to this Department—The field notes are to be made out on good paper of uniform size & with such margin as will admit of being bound in durable books to remain in the Treasury. 10" Yoſu) will observe that the Law requires that the Surveyor General, the Assistant Surveyors & Chain Carriers, should before entering on their several duties take an Oath or Affirmation faithfully to perform the same—Though not specially enjoined, it appears to be proper, that transcripts of the Oaths or Affirmations so taken, should be transmitted to this Department.” 11" You are authorised to draw from time to time, such a sum not exceeding four thousand Dollars, as shall be necessary to enable you to execute the duties before mentioned, observing that your drafts are to be of the form, hereto annexed; Of all drafts you will advise me by the Post.— 12" You will be pleased to correspond with this Department stating the progress of the business committed to your management, and any points upon which further instructions shall appear necessary.— I have given directions to have a standard Chain prepared, by which to regulate the Chains of the Surveyors, which will be transmitted as soon as possible." In the meantime however your arrangements need not be suspended— As it may be difficult for you to procure suitable Stationary, the Register will by my direction transmit a few blank books, suitable for the records of the field notes and a quantity of paper on which the plats of Townships are to be protracted.” The Act of Congress makes no provision for Clerkship in your Office, although it is certain that the service of a Clerk will be necessary.—Though I have no authority to stipulate for the United States on this subject, yet I do not hesitate to advise you to keep your accounts & records in perfect order, in confidence that Congress will hereafter authorise any necessary and reasonable expence.” The Secretary of War will direct that that the escort which may  attend the running of the Indian boundary shall assist in marking the line in a proper manner—With this aid, I have no doubt, that an allowance of three dollars per Mile will be found sufficient.” I have &c &c O.

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JOSIAH MUNROE 20  GEN POST OFFICE March 17th 1797. JOSIAH MUNRO esq." SIR If M Greene is of opinion that he cannot execute the Contract he has made with the public and should be disposed to relinquish it I wish to have the Mail carried from Wheeling to Prestons agreeable to the former establishment a Schedule of which is enclosed for your information.  It will be necessary for M" Greene, if he gives up the Contract, to continue carrying the Mail with his Boats until you can be prepared for entering upon this Service. The Boats M* Greene has provided are on the whale boat Construction and I am told are well calculated for Navigating the Ohio you will of course employ them if it can be done to advantage on the plan in contemplation if not it is probable the Old Boats are not disposed of and may be readily got but at any event suitable ones can be procured for the purpose. they cost Twenty five Dollars and can be purchased without any difficulty You are well situated for superintending the boats of the upper and middle station and I have no doubt can get good hands on the terms offered. You will be allowed five p' Cent on all monies received and paid in transacting the business and I rely on your utmost exertions to make the most speedy and effectual arrangements for carrying that Mail, if M' Greene relinquishes his Contract in which case you will give the earliest information to M* D* Hebecourt to whom I have written on the subject and who is to have the direction of the lower Boat. Any expences incurred for Boats &c you may draw for on this Office or I will remit you the money if more agreeable to you I am &c J. H. 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO CHARLES GREENE  , March 17* 1797 CHARLES GREENE esq." SIR Your Letters of the 13" and 27th Ult” are received the former on the 10" and the latter on the 16 Instant in both of which you assure me that the Boats will answer.” Judge then Sir how much I was surprised at hearing there were no Mails from the State of Kentucky by the last Post. the latest date from that quarter is a mail of the 29th of December which was received the Post before the last—This is equal to a total stoppage of the communication by Post on that route, and I am induced to think you have undertaken a business that can never be duly executed. The Circumstance you mention of not receiving the Mail at Wheeling until Sunday Morning could not prevent your bringing up the Mails from Prestons though it might possibly create a weeks delay in receiving the Kentucky Mails at this City.—Under the former establishment the Mails were received here every week, frequently they were a week or two out of the regular course but nothing like the present failures was ever experienced. My duty obliges me to take prompt measures for placing this business on a proper footing but I wish to avoid any harsh steps on the occasion—You have entered into a Contract which I see very little probability of your executing I am sure you will be candid on a subject so interesting to the Public and if it should be the case you will not hesitate in relinquishing the Contract, if this happens I have empowered Mº Munro to make arrangements immediately for carrying the Mails on the former establishment and I must request you will employ your Boats until he is prepared to enter upon the business on the part of the public. Your regard for the reputation of the department and a proper sense of the Confidence I have reposed in you will induce you to use every means in your power to prevent failures until a regular establishment can be adopted by Mº Munro.—The Contractor between Pittsburg is directed to deliver the mail at Wheeling at 12 O Clock on Saturday” noon I am &c J H 
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO FRANCIS DE HEBECOURT  , March 17, 1797 FRANCIS D'HEBECOURT SIR. The failures in carrying the mail on the Ohio since the contract was put into M' Greens hands, induce me to conclude that it is impracticable to carry it regularly in the manner contemplated by M* Green. On that consideration I have desired him to relinquish his contract—if he does M. Munro (Postmaster at Marietta will immediately notify you of it. When you receive such information from Mº Munro, I wish you to procure what is necessary, and employ boatmen to carry the mail as it was carried the last year. For the expences attending it you can be reimbursed as heretofore. Should M" Green not relinquish his contract, it will be unnecessary for you to take any steps in the business. Perhaps the mail might now be carried by land with more expedition and regularity than by water; if that should be the case and M" Green relinquishes his contract, I wish you to have it carried either by water or land as you think will be most useful to the publick. I wish you to inform me what attention has been paid to the carriage of the mail by those employed since the contract was placed in M" Greens hands Mº Craig “ received a commission of five per cent on the monies expended by him in the carriage of the Ohio mail, for his agency in  the business. The same rate of commission on the monies you have laid out in the business will be allowed you when you shall forward your account for the purpose.” J. H. -

PETITION TO THE SENATE BY INHABITANTS OF GALLIPOLIS  [April, 1797] To The Honourable the Speaker & Members of the Senate of the United States in Congress The Petition of Stephen Monnot, Lewis Anthony Carpentier Lewis Vimont, Francis Walton, Lewis Philip Ach" Fichon, Anthony Maquet, Margareth G. C. Champagne Wife of Peter Anthº Laforge, Maria J. Dalliez, Wife of Peter Luc, all inhabitants of Gallipolis humbly Sheweth.” That by untoward events and unlucky Circumstances they are deprived of their Share in the Tract of Land, granted by the Honourable Congress in the Year 1795 to the Several inhabitants of that Settlement; their individual Applications verbally or by Writing to some Members of Congress in Order to obtain redress, having remained till now without effect; they take this present Mode to state the reasons, upon which they ground their request. They hope that the same reasons of Justice and benevolence which have actuated the Honourable Congress in 1795, in granting a Tract of Land to each of the inhabitants of that Settlement as a Sort of indimnification for the severe disappointment they have experienced in their purchase from the Scioto Company, will induce the present Honourable Congress to grant them the same quantity of Land as to those who have shared in that former grant. Your Petitioners do not mean to blame or criticize the mode adopted at that time, to divide the Tract granted between all those only who should appear personally on a certain day on the Spot, excluding all those absent at that time; but they have at least the right to lament the effect of that regulation; they would wish that that vigorous exclusion had applied only to those established in some other parts of the Union, or in foreign Countries, or who on Account of their easy Circumstances had relinquished all Idea of Settlement on that very Spott, and that some Provision might be made, in favor of those, whom this Act meant chiefly to relieve, who were in the number of the first Petition, and who were unable from imperious Circumstances to attend on the very day appointed. Your Petitioners hope that the reasons of their remissnes on that day, together with the Certificate of the time they have resided at Gallipolis, which are hereunto annexed, & submitted to the Consideration of the Honourable the Senate will obtain from them a favourable decision; they therefore pray, that You will grant to each of them, adjoining if possible the former Grant, the same Quantity of Land (216 Acres), which has been granted to those who attended the day fixed by Law, and as in duty bound they will ever pray &" Stephen Monot is the Same who came first from Gallipolis to Philadelphia in Order to petition Congress, he went to France in Order to bring his Wife with him to establish themselves on his Land, the Wessel having put back twice, prevented his being at Gallipolis on the day of the division of the Tract. Lewis Anth Carpentier was employed in the public Works at Presquisle at that very time. Lewis Vimont having lost his father when in Gallipolis and being an Orphan came in 1796 to Washington County in Pennsylvania to go to the School, he was Sick at the time of the division of the Land & the dryness of the Season has prevented his going down some weeks only after the appointed day Francis Walton was Soldier in the federal Army under General Wayne at the time appointed at Gallipolis. Lewis Philip A. Fichon was absent since the Year 1792, to provide for his Sustenance Anthony Maguet has not attained the age required by the Act of Grant, but is now Eighteen Years Old. Margareth Laforge has always resided at Gallipolis, but has been excluded by the Absence of her husband, who had purchased & really paid all the Amount to the Scioto Company. Maria Luc is in the same predicament as above having always resided there & being excluded by the Absence of her husband.—  Legis: 2º Sess. 5º Cong.

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO CHARLES GREENE  , April 21* 1797 CHARLES GREENE Esq." SIR Your favor of the 2" Instant * was received the Post before the last; the Pittsburg Mail which arrived yesterday brought nothing from Kentucky or the North Western Territory how this failure has happened I cannot at present say but I am rather inclined to think the Mail was not delivered at Wheeling in time for the Pittsburg Rider. It is more than probable that some of the failures of the Ohio Mail have been occasioned by the irregular Conduct of the Riders at each end of the water route but similar irregularities were experienced under the former arrangement for carrying that Mail without producing such delays and failures as have occurred since the Contract has been in your hands You were to have employed four Boats on the whale Boat construction each Navigated with two hands and from your Letter to me I had every reason to conclude that such Boats were used in the conveyance of that Mail and found to answer exceedingly well—in yours of the 21" of November * you observe that you have directed some to be built on that plan and in your Letters of a later date you mention “that the Boats employed by you will answer much better than any we have ever had on these waters”—After this information I was much surprised to hear from Gallipolis that no Boats on the new Construction were employed between that Place & Preston and from another quarter as you will find by the enclosed Extract of a Letter dated the 16" of March last that the Mail is entrusted to a Boy of 14 Years old in a small Canoe between Little Sandy and Preston. I will add Sir that this is confirmed in a letter I also received from the Post Master at Washington so that the fact is too well ascertained to admit of a doubt—Can it be supposed that  such a boy—is a proper Person to be entrusted with a Mail in a Canoe which cannot possibly live when the winds are high? Is an open Box or Blankett in such a Boat a Proper receptacle for the Mail? and is it a matter of any surprise if failures happen when a Boy of fourteen has to push a Canoe fifty miles against the stream?—To convince you that the Boatmen employed do not do their duty I know of one Instance lately when they did not even go from Gallipolis with the Mail for Kentucky—Under such circumstances I can only make you a partial payment of Four Hundred Dollars—This sum is in four Post Notes of One Hundred Dollars each Payable 30 Days after date to your self of the following Numbers 1445, 1446, 1447, 1448, You will be pleased to sign the receipt accompanying the notes and return it to this Office—If Boats on the whale Boat Construction are not procured for the lower Stations I must request that you will immediately have them built or purchased for the Department with proper Boxes fixed in the Boats and covered with Oil Cloth Mº Munroe at Marietta can certainly furnish the necessary Portmanteaus and he may retain the Balance of his present quarters account towards defraying the Expence thereof.--Whenever I am convinced that you have performed your Engagements with the Publick by carrying the Mail in a proper and regular manner which you must have it in your Power to prove by authentic and satisfactory vouchers I will Pay you the full sum stipulated in your Contract but with the Information I am possessed of at present I must in Justice to the Public retain as much of your Pay as will cover all the Penalties you appear to have incurred for Failures I am &c. J. H. The Pay of Eight men employed by the Agents of the Department under the former arrangement amounted including a Ration and a half a day priman to Fifteen Hundred & Eighty four Dollars a Year which leaves a Balance of Fourteen Hundred & Sixteen Dollars a year in your favor and is without doubt one of the best Contracts in the Department if not the best—The following is the Extract alluded too in the foregoing letter. Extract of a Letter from Mº John Graham at Preston Dated March 16" 97—“Our Mail is carried in such a careless irregular manner that the frequent miscarriage of Letters is to be expected—By the by I wish you would speak to the Post M General on this subject—M" Greene who has contracted to carry the Mail between this place and Wheeling certainly has not complyed with the spirit of his Contract I should not suppose that the PM. G. would be willing to trust the Mail to a small Boy about 14 Years Old and yet such a one takes it from this place in an open Box, until the last trip in a Blankett, to M* Gervais, from thence to Gallipolis I am told it has a similar conveyance—we have not received a Single Mail in due time.” 
RUFUS PUTNAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  MARIETTA May 6", 1797 SIR- Your favor of the 14" ult enclosing a copy of Gen' Waynes treaty with the Indians has been receiv'd "–I drew an Order this day, on the treasurer of the United States for two hundred & twenty dollars in favour of Dudley Woodbridge–Genl Wilkinson when on his way down the River, (a few days since) informed me that the Indians were invited by him to be at GreeneVill—the 20" Instant—to attend Running the boundary line of the reason which induced Genl Wilkinson to this measure I am Ignorant and for which I cannot account—because agreeably to your instructions—I was to “inform him when & where I should be ready to comence running the line.” And he must know that it was very uncertain whither the Surveyor could be procured, and in readiness by that time—However that nothing should be wanting on my part—that is possible to be effected I have forwarded to Cap' Ludlow the necessary powers & instructions for executing the Survey of the Indian boundary from Fort Recovery to Lorimies Store, and from thence to the Muskingum—presuming that he would undertake the bussiness; althoe I had had no answer to my letters to him on that subject—written soon after the receiving your instructions of the fourteenth of March—should Capt Ludlow agree to go forward with the Survey—as I trust he will it will be so far well; but with respect to making the line in a proper manner—according to what appears to me necessary—it is doubtfull if any thing will be done, unless Genl Wilkinson should receive some instructions on that head, from the Secretary of War—the enclosed copy of my letter to Gen' Wilkinson " will explain the reason of my doubts—in addition to which I would observe that the Genl. said if the troops were to labour they ought to be paid to be paid for it—However if Capt Ludlow agrees to undertake the bussiness he will mark the line in the Usual Manner, and a party may at any time, hereafter; open a vestage of such a width as Goverment should think proper to direct— I have the honour to be with much respect Sir Your Obt Sevt— RUFUS PUTNAM THE HONB" OLIVER WOLCOTT Esq.

RUFUS PUTNAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , MARIETTA May yº 18th 1797– SIR I herewith enclose a certificate made by Judge Woodbridge of my having taken the necessary oaths, to qualify me for executing the office of Surveyor Genl.,” the reason why it is of so late a date; it may be proper to explain: on my appointment in October last—I was sworn before Judge Symmes who certified on the back of the Commission—an appointment was afterward made with the Advice of Senate and a new Commission issued, on receiving of which it did not immediately occur to me that it was necessary I should be again sworn into Office “– I enclose transcripts of the Oath administered to Martin & Biggs; two of my Deputies, and of the Contract made with them for the survey of a part of the Military Land “–Capt Ludlow has agreed to survey the Indian boundary line from Fort Recovery to Lorimies Store, and from thence to the Muskingum River, he writes me that he shall be ready by the 20" inst he is instructed to make his way to the Muskingum by estimated courses, according to the best of his Judgment “to have each course measured with great exactness as well as run with much care, that his calculation for the true course may be as correct as possible, and having erected a very conspicuous monument at the point or station assigned by the Treaty, he will run the true course back seting a post at the end of every Mile and blaizing the line in the usual manner”— If Capt. Ludlow meets with no delay from the Indians I expect he will reach the crossing place above Fort Laurence about the first of July— Whither Gen' Wilkinson will furnish a party of axe men to open a Westage or not I am not informed but sure I am that it is a matter of no small consequence that it should be done— Martin and Biggs are ordered to Commence their Survey by the tenth of June—they will begin at the Northwest corner of the Seven Ranges and are not to cross the Muskingum, untill Capt Ludlow commences running the true line from thence toward Lorimies Store— The Agents of the Moravian Society have arived in this Country “ I expect to have the Survey of their lands commence about the tenth of June shall myself be on the spot to determine the location and from thence go up the river to meet Capt Ludlow at the crossing above Sort Lawrence—I have divided the Military tract into five districts— Martin & Biggs have the two eastern as per Copy of the Contract enclosed Mº Matthews " from the County of Hamilton I expect will have the North Middle district at three dollars per mile & a M. Jackson from Harrison County in Virginia is agreed with for the south Middle District at two dollars & an half per mile—but the contract is not yet executed, Capt Ludlow is to have the west District at three dollars p Mile—If no misfortune happens I trust the Survey of the whole will be compleat, and plans returned into your office by the first of January next— In your favor of the 14" of March 17 you informed me that you had directed a standard chain to be prepared—and the Register of the Treasury—to transmit a few blank books suitable for the records of the field notes—and a quantity of paper on which the plats of Townships are to be protracted—the blank books have arrived, but the chain has not, nor have I heard any thing of the paper which will be much wanted—a paper of a suitable quality for such plans cannot be procure'd here— - I have the honour to be with Great esteem Sir your most obed' Servent— RUFUS PUTNAM OLIVER WOLCOTT Esq."

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO CHARLES GREENE  , May 26* 1797 Mr CHARLES GREENE SIR. I am favored with your Letter of the 7" " Instant in reply to mine of the 27. Ult” " and enclosing a Letter from Mess" Meigs and Bureau " relative to their Conduct as your agents for conveying the Mail from Gallipolis to Preston. It is in vain to deny the want of method or Exertion in conducting the business committed to your charge as scarcely a Mail arrives without bringing an account of some failures on the River. A Gentleman from Washington informs me in a Letter dated the 3" Instant which I received by the last Post “That the Canoe which plies between Preston and M* Gervas returned the week before the last without any Mail, after having waited the expiration of their time.” and adds that there is very great mismanagement on the River. Notwithstanding I had every Reason for stopping a very large proportion of your pay for the last quarter, to stimulate you to proper exertions in addition to the Sum I forwarded you of Four Hundred Dollars “ Mº Wager was paid 250 Dollars more on your draft in his favor. I will however send on by the next Post an account of the failures and penalties you have incurred in consequence of them which will be deducted from your pay that become due on the 30" of June next unless you can offer satisfactory excuses for them Will you be so good as to answer the following Questions. Is the Mail carried in four Boats from Wheeling to Preston, and which are the Stations? Are the Boats built on the Whale Boat Construction, and navigated with two active able men each? Are Boxes fixed to the Boats for the reception of the Mails and are the Mails conveyed in Portmanteaus secured with Locks? I will thank you to be particular in answering these Questions by return of Post General Wilkinson and the Secretary of War have both complained of the careless manner of conveying the Mail on the Ohio I mention this to convince you that the complaints are from all Quarters; they are much too general to admit of the Insinuation of Mess” Meigs and Bureau that they originate with interested persons who are desirous of taking the business out of their hands.” I am &c J.

SIR I am favored with your Letter of the 6 Instant * and am glad to find that the Mail is now regularly carried on the Ohio.” M* Greene informs me that he could not get Boats built on the Whale Boat Construction but he says they are built from one stick of good Timber from which I conclude they are Canoes. Will you be so good as to inform me whether Canoes are in use between Preston and Gallipolis how many boats are employed on that part of the river and the number of hands in each boat? and what such Boats may be purchased for? Is there a good Box, covered with Tarr and Oil Cloth so as to make it water tight fixed in the Boat from Gallipolis to the first lower Station, and do you understand that the Mail is secured in the same manner from thence to Prestons? . I wish you to be particular in answering these Questions and will thank you for the earliest Information on the Subject I am very sorry that you have been so long kept out of the balance due from this Office. Mº Burral thinks you did not require its being sent to you before your last Letter. he now transmits the balance in Post Notes, and you will observe that I have allowed you five pº Cent Commission on the whole Sum you paid the Boatmen as that business was out of the line of your duty as a Post Master."

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  DEPARTMENT OF STATE June 30. 1797. WINTHROP SARGENT Esq." SIR I have received your private letter of the 3" instant," and read it to the President of the United States. He thinks it important to adopt the idea you suggest, that you should immediately proceed to the settlements on the Eastern Bank of the Mississippi, above the Ohio “to put the militia in the best possible State”. You know that he has not the power to confirm the untitled settlers in their possessions: but I am authorized to assure you, that he is disposed to quiet them, and to recommend their cases favourably to Congress. But by their fidelity to the United States, they cannot fail to recommend themselves: such fidelity as circumstances now call for, cannot pass unrewarded. The journey will occasion an expense which ought to be borne by the public. The President asked what would be necessary: I could not determine: but I assured him of your economy and good management. I leave it to yourself to draw on me for the requisite sum * I have the satisfaction to say that you possess the President's confidence.” With sincere respect and esteem I am, Dear Sir, your obedient Servant. TIMOTHY PICKERING. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  (private) PHILADELPHIA June 30. 1797. DEAR SIR, In addition to what is said in my public letter, I think it my duty to intimate to you, that there is too much ground to think that we have internal enemies—disposed to favour the views of France and Spain—perhaps to detach the whole western country from the United States. Shall I entrust you then to be on the watch for every symptom of discontent, for every act, for every speech, for every circumstance, which indicates a design injurious to the union. Such a conspiracy must have conspicuous men for leaders; and such demand the closest observation.” I am very truly yours T. PICKERING COL” WINTHROP SARGENT.

S. they would insist on their ancient rights to possess to the Southern margin of our river—he reckons much upon French Interest in Kentuckey—all this has just come to my knowledge—a Captain D'Habercourt now going to France from Cincinnati and who may probably call upon you as a Frenchman in all its Latitude. Major Rivoli's Information may be correct but I think some attention would make your Canadian French American—You will have heard that the Sons of the Duke of Orleans have passed northward (not in the Territory) and conducted improperly with the Indians— I calculate upon your approbation of all my public Conduct Sir because I shall endeavour to Deserve it and you could not have afforded me higher Justification than the Assurance “I possess the president's Confidence” “ I will not forfeit it—so exalted is his public and private Character in my View that to be well in his opinion is my high ambition— I am My Dear Sir with the most sincere wishes for the welfare of yourself & Family and with respectful Esteem your obedient humble Servant Your Letters to Detroit will generally find a ready Conveyance from Cincinnati—when necessary they will be despatched by Express—The Distance is 300 Miles and by the Communication of our Different forts their delivery may be made easy and expeditious.

ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE [OHS: Sargent Papers: C] private CINCINNATI the 14th of August 1797 DEAR SIR From Marietta Washington County I acknowledged the receipt (at that place) of several private as well as public Letters which you did me the honour to write me *—explained to you the Causes which had drawn me to that part of the Territory and thereby I trust have satisfactorily accounted why I am not at this Moment upon the Eastern banks of the Mississippi as it must fully appear I knew not the president's pleasure and was destitute of the means of proceeding *-I wait here only for a small Escorte which I expect from Gen' Wilkinson to whom I addressed a Line thereupon so soon as your Letters came to hand *— I have very often my Dear Sir taken Leave to press upon you the absolute necessity there is for the Judges to be more within the Territory and in my last Letter urged an Appointment to the vacancy made by Judge Turner—I presumed not to mention any Name & indeed I know not a suitable Character but I must add however to what I have already said upon this Subject that we should have a man more National than territorial or at least quite as much so— amongst us there is not I believe a suitable person—A Mº M*Millan formerly one of the Judges of the pleas in Hamilton County and now a practicing Attorney here of much popular Talent perhaps may be mentioned to you but it appears to me that neither his principles or his Abilities suit him by any means for the office—he will be very forward amongst those who shall first and soon advance to make of this a new State—I believe (for myself) that the period for such importance to us should be kept distant—at least that it should be delay'd till we acquire another Town than can be derived from such men as are generally first Settlers, or frontier people & until the majority of the Inhabitants be of such Characters & property as may insure national Dependance & national Confidence—at present, I have already told you Sir, but the matter may be of moment enough to repeat it, that I have not abundance of Faith in the national Attachment of the people from the Indian Line quite up to the new England Settlements upon Ohio Company Lands—many of them, are not the very best of a neighbouring State of Doubtful polities—their Independence (and greater Consequence may be accelerated or retarded by the general Government as they shall think proper for if I remember right it is provided that the States hereafter to be formed may not exceed one hundred Square Miles of Course there may be two Lines of more than 100 Miles (North and South) From the Line of Fort recovery to the Kentuckey and pennsylvania bounded upon the North by the Line of recovery & Fort Lawrance & by including the Country to Lake Erie there may be four distinct Governments—excepting therefrom the Territory west & north of the principal Indian Lines— and of this Exception I have presumed to give to you an Opinion heretofore that it should Constitute a separate Govern". You will pardon me my Dear Sir if I express myself too freely I have the public weal at heart and am really national. I consider myself writing a private Letter though it is but proper that every Species of Information of public moment may be communicated to the President—and if the Business of the Territory should come before Congress in their next Session I would request that all my private communications in which the Interests of the same or the Nation are involved may be freely imparted in Confidence to my Friend Mr Ross of the Senate in whose Abilities and respect for the sovereignty and honour of the United States I have the most implicit Faith—I had proposed to write him much and freely but my Tour to the west will prevent—indeed Sir this Government has actually become too unwieldy for all the attention of any one even the greatest man– The enclosed papers No 1 & 2* will evince to you I think Sir that I should instantly divide myself between Wayne County and those to the West; but, that Judge Gilman is now upon his way to Detroit I should apprehend much from the representation here enclosed— previous Letters from me Sir which you must have received will have prepared you to Expect to hear of uneasiness in that Quarter— I mentioned to you long since the Opinion of A St Clair Junº an Attorney Gen' upon the Exemptions and privileges of british Subjects by Treaty,” and the consequent Mischiefs I dreaded—Mr St Clair I am persuaded is a well meaning young Man, but I feel Confident that the Interests of the United States would be promoted if Congress should appoint (with a Salary) some most respectable Law Character to that office within the Territory— My responses to No 1 & 2 are enclosed—I have proposed to make them private because I can not but hope that the fears of the Magistrates are in some measure upon false Grounds, and I have specially written to Judge Gilman at Detroit to substantiate for me every thing I ought to know as properly preliminary to that kind of Decision which may become my Duty— Should it be found too true Sir that the Civil Authority is inadequate to Government you would supremely oblige me by your Counsels for in it I have the highest Confidence—I may find it necessary to proceed immediately from the Mississippi to Detroit—an early Letter therefore and which under any Circumstances (if you desired it) should be Considered as private might be highly advantageous to me and Government— From Detroit Sir I informed you that the records in which I believed our people were principally and almost alone interested had been carried to the british Side of the Line and demanded under my order by the recorder of Wayne County—to which has been made the reply No 3 A new Town is laid off by the British opposite Detroit and when I tell you that the Americans have christened it Smugglingburg you will possess our Idea of the Intention— I can not inform you precisely of the number dubbing themselves british Subjects in Wayne County—they however are considerable and I am assured from good Authority that “great pains were taken by some of the principal people british subjects” to get Signatures from poor ignorant simple people & who made their marks through fear & threats without knowing what they did”—these are the words of my respectable Correspondent who tells me that in a short Time he expects to make me a special Statement of the business— I am with Sentiments of most respectful Esteem your obedient humble servant W SARGENT  Copy of a Letter to the Secretary of State 14th August 1797[*] 
RUFUS PUTNAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  RAPIDS OF THE OHIO 8” of Sept 1797 SIR I was delay'd at Cincinnati after my Return from laying off the two Counties up the river in Expectation of receiving a small Escorte from General Wilkinson but his unexpected Tour to Michilimakinac depriving me of all hope of hearing from him in Season, upon the 4* Inst: I left Cincinnati- The enclosed were this morning received, and I trust the contents may establish with you the opinion I have very long entertained by a small Garrison of regular Troops being absolutely necessary upon the Mississippi—I proceed there this Day, my whole Force three hunters— but the Adventure seems to me absolutely necessary though I believe without the Countenance of some military Aid I may be but an efficient “Forlorn” for the Interests of Government— Mr Edgar the writer of one of the Letters is L' Col.

GENERAL JAMES WILKINSON TO JOHN EDGAR AND WILLIAM ST.

For many reasons I must enjoin it on you to hold this communication in strict reserve from all persons—for in these times it is difficult to tell who are our foes, or to know when or where we may have to fight— With consideration and esteem, I am Gentlemen Your most Obed" Servt— JA: WILKINSON MESS” EDGAR & ST.

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO RUFUS PUTNAM  TREASURY DEPARTMENT September 16** 1797 RUFUS PUTNAM Esquire Surveyor General SIR, I have received your Letters of the 1** & 2" instant *—the account rendered appears to be right, from a cursory examination except that there is not a receipt to M'. Wº Rufus Putnams account for surveying the Moravian Townships, this defect you will supply— If any error is discovered it will be pointed out to you by the Comptroller, whose duty it is finally to settle your accounts. It is very important that the Indians should be well satisfied with the manner in which the line is run—to prevent future uneasiness, the small deviation ought to be pointed out to some of the Cheifs.- if there appears to be the least discontent, I submit it to your consideration, whether a new line ought not to be run westward from the fork of Loramies Creek and the Miami, until it arrives so near the line marked by Mº Ludlow as to be easily connected with it. This may be done perhaps, when the lines of Townships are run without much trouble or expence. You will however judge whether this is necessary after bearing in mind that a considerable body of Land ought not to be considered as any equivalent for the mischief which would ensue from loosing any portion of the confidence of the Indians. I am disappointed in finding that a sufficient Escort was not appointed to attend Mº Ludlow for the purpose of marking the line in a durable and proper manner, nor can I account for the uncertainty expressed by Mº Ludlow, whether the Indians were duly notified— As General Wilkinson must necessarily have some agency in whatever concerns the intercourse with the Indians, and as this circumstance will render the responsibility for what is done more complex, than would be the case if one Officer only was concerned I would recommend to you the utmost punctuality in your correspondence with the General, and that you would endeavour to have every arrangement well concerted and mutually understood.—Of any difficulty which may arise, you will be pleased to keep me well advised.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  TRENTON. Sep 18th 1797. HIS ExCELLENCY ARTHUR Sº CLAIR ESQ', SIR. I rec" on the 14" your letter 11" inst." I do not know of any special bussiness requiring your presence in the Northwestern Territory this Fall; and the Circumstances you mention and particularly the necessity of your attending the sales of the public lands at Pittsburg, which would require your immediate return thither, were you to go down the river, may well excuse your forbearing to encounter, in your infirm state, the fatigues of the Journey. I am not in a situation to examine the question, Whether in the absence of the Governor, who is the superintendant of Indian affairs, the Secretary of the Territory can intermeddle in Indian affairs, as well as execute, conformably to the act of Congress of the 7" of August 1789,” all the powers of the Governor. I have not with me the ordinance under which the superintendant is appointed.” It is clear however, as you observe, that the Secretary's power is limited to the territory and the superintendant's embraces the whole northern Department. Nevertheless, occasions may occur in which the interests of the U. States may require an intercourse with the Indians residing in the Northwestern Territory, thro' a public agent, when the superintendant is absent, and in a situation not to attend within the requisite time & in such case, the Secretary would doubtless be excused for acting as his representative. The titles of the inhabitants of Detroit to lands in that District seem to me to demand the attention of Congress: I will lay the matter before the President prior to the next Sessions.” The provision of seals for the counties I will mention to my Chief Clerk, as soon as he joins me here, ascertain what has been done, & direct the execution of what is deficient I am very respectfully &c TIMOTHY PICKERING

And this Day I drew an ordor on the Treasurer for 813 Dollars 56 Cents in favor of Dudley Woodbridge— I herewith enclose my account of the quarter Commenceing the First day of July and ending the 30" of September inclusive with Cap" Ludlows account against me as a voucher, It is not in my power at present to have Capt Ludlows account Receipted, on account of his being in the woods surveying the Military Lands you must be sensible however that I am greatly in advance to him by my order on the Treasurer in his favor payable to M* Dayton—And with respect to the other surveyors I have advanced very considerable sums to them and have their receipt to account, and at the close of the present 10a Zenon Trudeau.  season of surveying when they return from the woods there accounts will be made out and the Necessary vouchers of my payments obtained and forwarded to the Treasury department, Indeed to close my accounts of payments with the Treasurer by producing to him the necessary Vouchers more then one in a year will be found impracticable because the surveyors from the opening of the spring untill neerly the setting in of Winter will be in the Woods, and to oblige them to make returns once a quarter would put it altogether out of their power to execute the surveys at the stipulated price for if they were to attempt to make these returns in the woods and forward them to me neerly half the time of all there hands would be lost, and besides it is impossible for them to Copy their minuts and make the plans in the woods with any degree of accuracy and neatness— I have the honor with great Respect to be Sir your obedient Servent RUFUS PUTNAM S G OLIVER WALCOTT Esquire Secretary of the Treasury  Nº 13 Marietta October 7" 1797 Rufus Putnam—Surveyor General—Recorded in Surveyor Generals Book page 37. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  DEPARTMENT OF STATE TRENTON Oct 16. 1797. THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SIR By the last mail I received from Winthrop Sargent Esq. Secretary, and Acting Governor of the Northwestern Territory, advice of his draught on me for One Thousand Dollars.” He had more than once represented the Extreme hardship of being obliged to perform all the duties of those two offices; and especially in making long journies, without any Compensation beyond his small salary as Secretary. The information received last summer, which was laid before the president, appeared to require Col" Sargent's going to the settlements on the Mississippi, but to which the expence was an Essential obstacle. The President directed an Allowance to be made. I wrote Col” Sargent accordingly: but not being able to calculate the expence, I left it to him to draw on me for the requisite sum." Hence this bill for $1000. which being evidently disproportioned to that Single Service, doubtless was meant to embrace former like expenditures, particularly those occasioned by his Journey last year to Detroit, to organize a Government, after a surrender of the posts. I have no doubt the President will be willing to make a reasonable allowance for the expence of those other services, on a fair statement of them. At any rate, the bill being drawn, I am desirous of paying it; leaving it to Col" Sargent hereafter to account for the application. I therefore pray you to give directions or authority to Mr Simpson, Cashier of the U States Bank, to pay the thousand Dollars to my order; the fund will be the Contingent Expences of Government I am very respectfully &c TIMOTHY PICKERING

I have now determined to send a Mail on the route once in two weeks, if it can be done on reasonable terms, & for that purpose I have this day written to Worden Pope esq." Post Master at Louisville Ky. and have desired him to procure a contract to be commenced immediately. I therefore hope that a communication with Kaskaskias will be soon opened, and have now to request that you will nominate a suitable person to hold the Office at Kaskaskias and have him execute the bond and take the oaths enclosed and return them to this Office when a commission will be duly forwarded, in the meantime to prevent delay he may commence the business of the Post Office A Copy of the Post Office Law with instructions, table and forms of accounts for the use of the Post Office are sent herewith.” I am &c C.

CHARLES BURRALL TO WORDEN POPE  GENL. POST OFFICE DEPT. December 15th 1797 WoRDEN POPE Esq." SIR I wish to obtain a contract for carrying the Mail from Louisville by Vincennes to Kaskaskias once in two weeks until the first day of April 1798. from your former connection with the department I take the liberty to request you to endeavour to make a Contract for that route. The distance I am informed is two hundred and sixty miles, being 100 from Louisville to Vincennes and 160 from Vincennes to Kaskaskias The average price of carrying Mails once in two weeks, thro' the United States is at the rate of two dollars and a half a mile by the year counting the distance one way. at that rate a compensation for carrying the Mail from Louisville to Kaskaskias would be six hundred & fifty Dollars for a year, and I should suppose it might well be done for that sum, as the carier would not have many tavern bills to pay on the route, if however the contract cannot be obtained for that sum I wish you to contract on the best terms you can provided you do not exceed the rate of seven hundred & eighty dollars a year. I should not chuse to go higher than this last sum. I am informed that the road from Louisville to Vincennes, is tollerable tho not very good, but from Vincennes to Kaskaskias the path is very good, and the whole route may be performed in six days in summer and in seven days in winter. I. enclose a blank contract and bond which if you find a proper person to contract I wish you to fill up and have properly executed and return them to this office when I will execute a counterpart of the contract and forward to you. If you should not be able to obtain a contract on the above terms I wish you to send an express with the enclosed papers for Vincennes & Kaskaskias, if a contract is made it will be sufficient to send them by the mail carrier, the expence of such an express will be paid to your order or remitted by post as you shall direct. Note. Your letter of the 14* October” with your accounts was duly received. Agreeably to your recomendation I have this day forwarded an appointment for Mº John Eaton. I am &c C.B.

J. SAVARY TO SENATOR JOHN BROWN , |January 6, 1798) SIR Among the Objections which have been made to me in the commitee, two appear to me more weighty and as I fear to have not explained myself clearly enough verbally, I take the liberty to repeat again my answers as to the first point that to grant a new tract for the 8. new claimants, will be a dangerous precedent and lay the ground for some future claim. I have answered that it was less dangerous in this case than in any other, because the number of the real inhabitants in Gallipolis was perfectly known & ascertained at the time of the inscription of their name in 1795 to share in the grant & it was remembered & observed by all those presents, that the others who petition now were excluded by the reasons exposed in the petition and when they have requested me to Act for them I have asked them an exact note of all the claimants and it was a thing very easy at this time Since November 1795. in such a confined settlement: Some other people certainly have bought from the Scioto company; but they have not inhabited in Gallipolis and are gone in Europe, or in the spanish Settlements and their rights as purchasers are preserved for their contracts With the Scioto company by the said act of grant by Congress in 1795 which had in view to relieve only the inhabitants of Gallipolis” the second objection is, that Congress, or Executive having devised the mode of division among the inhabitants for the grant cannot be troubled again by those who have not appeared at the time fixed. That objection cannot concern the two ladies Laforge & Luc, who have constantly inhabited and who have been excluded from a participation in the grant, because their husbands, who only had right, were absent: it cannot concern [blank] who was inhabited at the time; but had not attained yet the full age of 18 years fixed by the act; as to all the five others some were ignorant of the grant some have been in the impossibility to come at the time and have exposed their reasons in the petition, which reasons are known by all the settlers of Gallipolis: it is more natural to think that at the moment of the act granting that tract in 1795. those who petition now, were in reality in full right of their share, being plainly & fully within the description contemplated by the act; and indeed it is to be wished that some other mode had been devised & to make some reservation for those Who  had a right to share in the grant & would not, in so remote a country, come at a single proclamation calling all those concerned who might be scatered in this extensive continent: perhaps some delay and some iterative advertisement could have been granted without great inconveniency; because the obligation to appears personally was, it seems, too rigourous and the exclusion too hard for those who had all the qualifications contemplated by the act; but might be delayed by some untoward events. As that Grant of 24000. acres was rather an act of Generosity or reward, than of Strict Justice it appears clearly that those who are really in the description of those that Congress had in view to relieve, cannot be deprived of that gratuity and separated now of the Companions of their dangers and misfortunes in the time of the indian war, on account of their not having fulfilled Strictly the terms of the law; Thus in granting their demand Congress will accomplish their true intention at the time of the first Grant in 1795. I have the honour to be respectfully Sir Your most obed" & humble servant J SAVARY PHILAD" 6th Jan'y 1798. J" BROWN Esq." [Addressed] Hon” John Brown Senator of the United States.— Philadelphia 
PETITION TO CONGRESS FROM INHABITANTS OF THE SCIOTO  [February 1, 1798) To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled * The petition of the inhabitants of the Sioto River in the Territory of the united States North West of the Ohio River Humbly sheweth”— That your petitioners claiming no landed property in the different parts of the united states from which they removed and being unable to purchase land at the enormous prices it sold for in those parts with the little money they had earned by their honest Industry being well convinced that their little All would be inadequate to purchase a Sufficient quantity at the present prices to enable them to rear their tender offsprings in a comfortable manner Under these circumstances and prompted by a desire natural to the human mind of Obtaining barely a competency in life they have left their friends and dearest connections have taken their lives as in their hands and faced danger and all the hardships attendant on the first setlers of an uncultivated frontier forest which many of your Honourable house no doubt have been well acquainted with and consequently will feel for those in similar circumstances—Your Honourable body passed a law on the 18" day of May 1796* providing for the sale of the lands of the United States North West of the Ohio River—by this law we find a reserve is made of a certain part of those lands another part is to be disposed of in tracts containing 5760 Acres and the remaining part in tracts of 640 Acres——We also find that one half of the purchase money is to be paid down and the other half if not punctually paid within twelve months next after the time of the purchase being Made forfiets the first sum paid–On a consideration of this law we humbly conceive the smallest tracts too large for us to purchase and Risk the loss of half the purchase money and when we farther consider that one half the lands are to be disposed of in tracts containing 5760 we consider ourselves in a truly deplorable situation and should an indian War take place (which may God forbid) we leave your Honourable Body to Judge of our situation—Sixty miles from any settlement of consequence in the midst of an Indian Country and the most exposed part thereof—Disappointed in getting lands on easy and equitable terms in hopes of which we adventured our lives and the lives of our families.— The Virginia Military lands on the lower side of the Sioto are held Generally by persons who will neither sell or settle them—Those on the upper side of the Sioto are to be disposed of in such large tracts and on such Terms that we cannot become purchasers—Many of our nearest friends in a state of despondency have Accepted of the offers offers of the King of spain in his proclamation of the [blank in MS.] (current at present in the North Western territory) and have and are daily removing from their own country This is a fact too notorious to be denied Your petitioners therefore humbly hope and pray that your Honourable Body will take this subject into your consideration and pass a law Authoriseing the Surveyor General to lay of a tract of land on the Sioto river Thirty miles Square Beginning Opposite to the Mouth of Paint creek thence up the river Sioto Thirty miles on a straight line Thence making a right angle with the General course of the river thirty miles thence parellel with the Gen' Course of the river Thirty miles and thence to the Beginning and farther directing him to subdivide the same The one half into tracts of containing 160 acres and the other half into tracts of 640 acres Your petitioners further Humbly pray that the said Tracts of land may be sold to none but those who will become actual setlers thereon or have them setled in a limitted time which they may not exceed twelve months from the time of such purchase being made Your petitioners Humbly beg leave to suggest whether it would not tend to the more speedy settle- * Ante, p. 552. ment of the lands and bringing the Value Thereof sooner into the publick Treasury was the price lowered or the present mode of sale Altered—Your petitioners humbly beg leave to mention that was your Honourable Body to grant this their petition (which they hope and trust you will) the interest of their common country would be promoted and that in case an indian war should take place they would be so strengthened as to be able to defend themselves and prevent the effusion of the Blood of their wives children and friends— And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray &c James Mennery John Graves James Kilgore Bazil Abrams Rob" M*Mahan Sam' Davis Jerº M*Lane Ab" Davison John M'Coy W" Kilgore Charles Jamison Adam Turner Hugh Menery James Brown

THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ACTING GOVERNOR SARGENT  DEPARTMENT OF STATE March 9. 1798. WINTHROP SARGENT Esq." Secretary of N. W. Territory. SIR, This morning I received your letter of the 8" of January.” You have justly discredited the news of an intended invasion of the Illinois, as transmitted to you from Kaskaskias. There are probably about 200 or 250 men at Nogales—Col." Howard” when he descended from fort Louis carrying with him only about 100, as a letter from Capt. Guion” now rec" informs us; and the Garrison at the Natchez consists of about 50 men. Further, you will see by the newspapers, that our intelligence from New Orleans, dated in Dec' & Jan’, advises that Gov" Gayoso has received orders from Spain to deliver up the forts in the Natchez district, and to run the boundary line. I believe it is to be depended on. The Spanish Consul at New York has made no secret of it: He communicated it to his brother Stoughton, the Spanish Consul at Boston, who freely communicated it, and told a friend of mine there that he had a copy of the order in Spanish. Further still, I am satisfactorily informed, that the Chevalier d’Yrujo has received the like advices from Gov" Gayoso, altho' he  has not communicated it to our Government—deeming it improper to do it, seeing it was not transmitted to him directly from his Court. Last week I received your report of the executive proceedings in the N.W. Territory.* We have at last received letters from our Envoys at Paris. On the 4" instant arrived the first letter from them since they left Holland; it is dated the 8" of January, was laid before Congress, and will be found in the Newspapers. They had not been and did not expect to be received, or in any manner to accomplish the object of their mission. Nothing short of abject submission to arbitrary and unwarrantable demands will satisfy the present imperious rulers of France It will ultimately appear that our Envoys have as was to be expected from their characters, conducted themselves with ability, dignity & firmness—while they manifested the most forbearing patience. Their other letters prior to that of the 8" of January are very interesting—I suppose they will not for some time be made public. I am respectfully &c - TIMOTHY PICKERING 
RUFUS PUTNAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  MARIETTA, March ye 9* 1798 SIR I have lately receiv'd a letter from Capt Ludlow informing me that he had completed, the survey of the Western District of Military lands, and that his returns will be ready in a short time *— Martin & Biggs have disappointed me exceedingly they both commenced their surveys, last June, and by contract, were to complete them within four Months which they might easily have done, if no misfortune or negligence had taken place, their Districts were seperate althoe their Contract was joint—Martin is more than two thirds in arear, and Biggs nearly one half Capt Biggs's excuse is, that he was taken sick the 2" of August, and obliged to retire from the woods—and was not able to reassume his work, untill the 23" day of October, and obliged to quit again, the 22" of November on account of the severity of the weather; he assures me that he will be out again this Spring as soon as the season will permit— Capt Martin I have not yet seen, but learn that he left the woods sometime in July or August and has not been out since, of which circumstance I had no notice ’till within these few weeks, his excuse is sickness in his Family; but I find this must have been late in the fall, and I apprehend, after the time had elaps'd in which, by Contract he ought to have completed his work in the field; Capt Martin has formerly executed some surveys for the United States with accuracy and punctuality which induced me to give him a District, in preference to some others, but at present I am quite disatisfied with his conduct, and if he does not exert himself to complete the survey of his District early this spring, I shall employ some other means to effect it— With respect to the other public land my intention is to survey in the course of the present year, All the land lying south of the Military tract, and west of the Ohio Companies purchase and the seven Ranges; extending westward as far as the Sioto River, estimated at about 3,150,000 acres the survey of this tract will employ six surveyors—and arrangements are making accordingly— I also propose to survey in the course of the present year that tract of land lying below the Great Miami River, and above the mouth of Kentuckey river extending West toward the Indian boundary as far as shall be judged prudent without giving cause of Alarm at the same time by running out one or two Ranges of Townships on the west side of the great Miami extending as far North as fort Recovery, and the fork of Loramies Creek I shall be able to assertain the true course of the Indian boundary without the expence of running a random line, as we were obliged to do at the Northward—as soon as this is done General Wilkinson will be notified of the time and place when & where we shall be ready to commence running the Indian boundary line from the fork of Loramies Creek to fort Recovery and thence to the Ohio agreeably to Gen' Wayn's treaty—As soon as the Indian boundary lines are completed—it is intended to complete as soon as may be the survey of the whole tract of land west of the Great Miami included within those boundary lines"— I have the Honor to be with due respect Sir your obedient Serv'.

That auspicious Day on which the United States took a rank among the nations, which they have maintained with Dignity and honor for two and twenty years, was well chosen to take into Consideration the horrid depredations committed on the Property of your fellow Citizens by the Cruisers of the French Republic, the neglect to adopt measures for Reparation, and the contumelious Treatment of our Envoys, and through them of our nation. Your approbation of the part acted on the great Theatre, by your first Magistrate, by your Envoys and the great Councils of your nation, with relation to the French Republic, is very acceptable. And as all who drink the Western Waters think alike, we may hope that your sentiments are as extensive as those waters. Although you express with great Modesty your assurance that your efforts shall not be wanting to support the Independence, sovereignty and honor of our Nation, yet I am not the less confident that in case of Necessity they will not be feeble.

It being of the utmost importance to the United States, that all such lawless proceedings should be checked at the first outset—I have to request that you will immediately take measures for ascertaining how far this representation is correct, and report the result of your enquiry to me. I hope you will be able to return the plans of the military lands in November next as mentioned in your Letter of the 3" of August last"—that I may have it in my power to make a report thereon to Congress early in the Session.

For this purpose it will be necessary to employ some trusty person either at Willstown or at Zanes on the Muskingum to open the mail and take out such papers & mails as are directed to your Office and also to place in the mail such as may be forwarded from your Office for other Offices. I have therefore to request you to employ a suitable person if one can be found there to do that business for which service I will allow him thirty dollars a year being the same that is now paid for like services at Preston. The person thus employed must take & subscribe the oaths of which I enclose you a form & return them to me. Inclosed is a key which is to be delivered him to enable him to open the mail. The riders from Pittsburg & from Maysville are to meet at Zanes every Monday evening and I should wish a person living there may be employed if one of proper character can be found. I wish you also to contract with some person to carry the mail between your Office & Willstown or Zanes on the best terms that you can not going higher than at the rate of six dollars a mile by the year counting the distance one way; for that purpose.

PETER AUDRAIN TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR , DETROIT, November 1, 1798. SIR. In obedience to your Excellency's orders, I have requested a Magistrate of each Township to cause the enumeration of the free males Inhabitants of Wayne county, to be taken as soon as possible. I was lucky in finding an opportunity for Michilimackinac and receive the Return. I now have the honor to inclose you a general Return of the free Males of the age of Twenty-one years and upwards, of the four townships of Wayne county. Your Excellency will See that in the return of Michilimackinac, there are 700 Engagés or hired men to merchants for the Indian trade, over and above the Residenters of that place. it is, as I am informed by the Magistrates at that post, about one-half only of the Engagés Resorting thither, every summer, but the other half is composed of Canadians coming from Montreal, of course not intitled to the rights of Citizens of the United States.” There are many people omitted in the Returns, particularly in Sargent's and Hamtramck's Townships, as you will See by the Return Certified by the Sheriff of the County, &"— I Beg leave to assure Your Excellency that no time has been lost Since the receipt of your orders, and that no opportunity before this, has offered to forward the Return to the Seat of Government. very little difficulty has been experienced in taking the enumeration of the people, but a very great one will exist in finding Men fit to represent the County in general assembly, if organized. the best informed, in general, are the british Subjects, by their own election, of course, not eligible, and I do not Know one Single Canadian who understands english enough to be a representative. we have three or four Gentlemen who would do very well, but their occupations are Such that I am afraid will not admit of their absence; the Canadians now feel for want of education, and are anxious for an opportunity of getting their children taught, to Read and write, and especially the English language. I think it my duty to inform Your Excellency that the Commandand" of this post has granted an acre of Ground on the Commons Joining the Town, to be used as a burying-ground for the Roman Catholics; this grant answers a very good purpose, as their old burying-ground Joining their church, and within the pickets, is so full that it is a real publick Nuisance, and had been presented as Such by Several Grand Juries. I have heard that the Indians in the Neighborhood of St. Joseph- Seem disposed to do mischief. my information is from James May, Esq" one of our Justices, who lately received a letter from his friend Mr. Burnet,” merch" at St. Joseph. this information has been communicated to the Commandant of this post, who probably has taken the necessary Steps to counteract the Maneuvers of the Wicked Indians. all is quiet here; Indians are generally [MS. torn] gone to their Winter Grounds; we have less of them at this moment than any period Since I have been in Detroit. I have the honor to be with great Respect Your Excellency's very humble and most obedient Servant PETER AUDRAIN. DETROIT 1st November 1798 HIS EXCELLENCY, THE GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY.  From Peter Audrain Nov. 1. 1798.
