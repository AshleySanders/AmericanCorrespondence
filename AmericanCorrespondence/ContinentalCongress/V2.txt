
I. The President of Congress (John Hancock) to the 
New Jersey Convention.

Philadelphia July 5th. 1776. 
Gentlemen: 

You will perceive, by the enclosed Resolve that the Congress have 
judged it necessary to remove the Prisoners from your Colony to York 
Town in Pennsylvania, and have directed me to request you to carry the 
same into Execution immediately. Their Vicinity to our Enemies, and 
the opportunity of deserting to them, or keeping up a Communication 
dangerous to the Interest of these United States, render this Step not 
only prudent but absolutely necessary.^ 

I do myself the Honour to enclose, in Obedience to the Commands of 
Congress, a copy of the Declaration of Independence, which you will 
please to have proclaimed in your Colony in such a Way and Manner as 
you shall judge best. 

The important Consequences to the American States from this Declara- 
tion of Independence, considered as the Ground and Foundation of a 
future Government, will naturally suggest the Propriety of proclaiming 
it in such a Mode, as that the People may be universally informed of it.* 

2. Elbridge Gerry to James Warren.

Philadelphia, July 5, 1776. 
Dear Sir: 

I have the pleasure to inform you that a determined resolution of the 
Delegates from some of the Colonies to push the question of Indepen- 
dency has had a most happy effect, and, after a day's debate, all the Colo- 
nies, excepting New York, whose Delegates are not empowered to give 
either an affirmative or negative voice," united in a declaration long sought 
for, solicited, and necessary â€” the Declaration of Independency. 

New York will most probably, on Monday next, when its Convention 
meets for forming a constitution, join in the measure, and then it will 
be entitled The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United 
States of America 

3. John Hancock to William Cooper.

Philadelphia 6 July, 1776 
My dear Sir 

.... I hope we shall be a free and happy people, totally unfetter'd, 
and Releas'd from the Bonds of Slavery. That we may be thus free, 


 

Congress have done, and will still do. more, to promote it. Inclos'd 
voii have the Declaration of Indcpciulence, to which Refer yon. I write 
the Assemhly, and it is the wisii of Conj^rcss the Declaration may he 
proclaim'd in the State of Massachnsetts Bay 

4. The President of Congress (John Hancock) to 
George Washington.* 

Philadelphia Jnly 6, 1776. 

Sir 

The Congress, for some Time past, have had their Attention occupied 
by one of the most interesting and important Subjects that could possibly 
come before them ; or any other Assembly of Men. 

Altho it is not possible to foresee the Consequences of Human Actions, 
yet it is nevertheless a Duty we owe ourselves and Posterity, in all our 
public Counsels, to decide in the best Manner we are able, and to leave the 
Event to that Being who controuls both Causes and Events to bring about 
his own determinations. 

Impressed with this Sentiment, and at the same Time fully convinced, 
that our Affairs may take a more favourable Turn the Congress have 
judged it necessary to dissolve the Connection between Great Britain 
and the American Colonies, and to declare them free and independent 
States; as you will perceive by the enclosed Declaration, which I am 
directed to transmit to you, and to request you will have it proclaimed 
at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think most proper.^ .... 

5. Thomas Jefferson to Richard Henry Lee.* 

Philadelphia, July 8, 1776. 
Dear Sir: 

For news, I refer you to your brother, who writes on that head. I 
enclose a copy of the Declaration of Independence, as agreed to by the 
House, and also as originally framed : you will judge whether it is the 
better or worse for the critics. I shall return to Virginia after the nth 
of August. I wish my successor may be certain to come before that time :

6. The President of Congress (John Hancock) to Horatio Gates/ 

Philadelphia, July 8th, 1776. 
Sir: 

The Congress being informed by Letter from General Schuyler to 
General Washington, which was laid before them at the Request of the 
former and by your own Consent, that a difference of Opinion had arisen 
between General Schuyler and yourself with Regard to the Command of 
the Army in the Northern Department, they immediately took the Matter 
into Consideration, and have this Day come to the enclosed Resolution, 
which I do myself the Honour of transmitting in Obedience to their 
Commands. 

You will there preceive, that Congress are of Opinion your Command 
was totally independent of Genl. Schuyler, while the Army was in Canada, 
but no longer and indeed, the Terms in which the Resolve, relative to 
your Appointment, is conceived, seem to shew that this was their Inten- 
tion. You were expressly, by that Resolve, to take the Command of the 
Troops in Canada; Words, which strongly imply, that they had no 
Design to divest Genl. Schuyler of the Command while the Troops were 
on this side Canada. I am however to inform you, that Congress highly 
approve your Resolution and Magnanimity that the public Service should 
receive no Detriment from any Difference of Opinion on the Occasion. 
It is their most earnest Desire, you will go on to act in the same Manner, 
and cultivate Harmony in all your military Operations. A good Under- 
standing and mutual Confidence are so essentially necessary in Order to 
give Success to our Measures, that I am convinced, they will take Place 
on all Occasions between you. 

He deserves most of his Country, and will undoubtedly meet with the 
greatest applause, in whatever Rank or Station he may be, who renders 
her the most useful and signal Services.^ 

2 In a letter to Edmund Pendleton, of which only a fragment, without date, exists, 
Jefferson says : " I am sorry the situation of my domestic affairs renders it indispensably 
necessary that I should solicit the substitution of some other person here in my room. 
.... I would not urge it again were it not unavoidable. I shall with cheerfulness 
continue my duty here till the expiration of our year by which time I hope it will be 
convenient for my successor to attend" {Writings, ed. Ford, II. 6i). The end of the 
delegation year was Aug. 11. See the Virginia credentials, the Journals, Aug. 28. As 
Richard Henry Lee was given a committee appointment Aug. 27, he probably attended 
on that day. Jefferson left Philadelphia Sept. 2.

7. Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston/ 

Philadelphia, July 8th, 1776. 
Dear Sir 

.... I received a Letter from your Committee of Secrecy War and 
iiitellig-ence respect iui,'- the e.xpediency of Fortifying- the harbour of Cape 
Lookout.- I laid the matter before a Committee ^ of Cong:ress appointed 
to consider what i)laces were proper to be I'Ortifyed but before they con- 
sider and make report thereon it is absolutely Necessary they should 
have a plan or Map of the harbour with proper e.\i)lanations and dis- 
criptions. These should be taken by an engineer on the spot who should 
form a plan of the Fortilications necessary to be made and the expence 
that would attend it. I have wrote to Mr. Harnett twice on the subject 
but as I have reason to believe many Letters Miscarry I now mention the 
matter to you, in hopes you will endeavour to prevail on the Council of 
Safety to get the matter done as early as possible. I find a disposition in 
most of the Members of Congress to grant to our Province all that can be 
reasonably expected, it is not in their power to assist us at present with 
Cannon, but as several Forges are beginning- to Cast twelve and eighteen 
pounders I hope towards Winter they will not only have it in their power 
but be heartily disposed to assist us with some heavy pieces to put into 
such places as may be thought ^lost advisable. This is all you can expect, 
it is all that is done in the like cases, the works must be done At your 
ow'n expence or by such Continental Troops as may be in the province for 
the time being. I give you this as my opinion, perhaps tliey may do 
more for our Province, it stands high in Rank, and high in estimation. 
I wish it may be able to support its good character in future 

My friend Penn came time enough to give his vote for independance. 
I send you the declaration inclosed, all the Colonies voted for it except 
New York, that Colony was prevented from Joining in it by an old 
Instruction. Their Convention meets this da}'^ and it is expected they will 
follow the example of the other Colonies.* 

I had the weight of North Carolina on my shoulders within a day or 
two of three months, the service w^as too severe. I have sat some days 
from Six in the morning till five, and sometimes Six in the afternoon 
without eating or drinking. My health was bad, such close attention 
made it worse, I nevertheless obstinately persisted in doing my duty to 
the best of my Judgment and abilities and attended Congress the whole 
time, one day only excepted, this I did contrary to the repeated solicita- 
tions of my friends, some of whom I believe thought I should not be able 
to keep Soul and body together 'till this time, duty, inclination and self 
preservation call on me now to make a little excursion in the Country to

manner we can to prevent Burgoyne from passing tliem and entering the

A paper has been privately laid on the Congress Table importing that 
some dark designs were forming for our distruction, and advising us to 
take care of ourselves, some were for examining the Cellars under the 
Room where we set.*^ I was against it and urged that we ought to treat 
such information with Contempt and not show any marks of fear or 
Jealousy. I told some of them I had almost as soon be blown up as to 
discover to the world that I thought my self in danger, no notice has 
been taken of this piece of information which I think is right

Philadelphia, July 8, 1776. 
My dear Sir: 

Yours of the 24th ultimo I liave received. It grieved me that the 
frigates cannot be got to sea, which I am sensible they might before this, 
had proper attention been paid to cannon in season. I have been a long 
time endeavouring to draw the attention of the Committee to the regula- 
tion of the Navy, but hitherto without success. The present establish- 
ment certainly needs amendment, but business is so exceedingly pressing 
that it is impossible to form a judgment when it will be done 

I must refer you to the papers for news, as time just now is very* 
precious. The Declaration will no doubt give you pleasure. It will be 
published next Thursday at the head of the Army at New York.^ I am 
told it is to be published this day in form in this city.^ .... 

[P. S.] I hope you will take care that the Declaration is properly 
treated.* ....

Assembly and to the officers of our Army if they are not there is nothing 
compulsory in them Congress would not strictly comply with the Request 
we were ordered to make on this Subject lest they should establish a Pre-

have therefore been obliged to vary our application and to adopt such 
Resolutions as seemed most conformable to the Intentions of our Congress 
and most likely to give Satisfaction to the Of^cers of our Army. 

Inclosed also are some other occasional Resolutions of Congress and 
a very important Declaration which the King of Great-Britain has at last 
reduced us to the necessity of making, all the colonies were united upon 
this great Subject except New- York whose Delegates were restrained by

As Mr. Anderson appears to be an ingenious Man, and proposes to

him an opportunity of trying the Experiment, and have therefore thought 
proper to refer him to you. 

The Event only can shew whether his Scheme is visionary or practic- 
able. Should it be attended with Success, (and the very Chance of it is 
sufficient to justify the Attempt) the infinite Service to the American 
States arising therefrom, cannot be described. Or should it fail, our 
Situation will be, in every Respect the same as before." ....

In obctlience to the Comniatids of Conprcss. I have enclosed you two 
Copies of sundry Resolves they have passed, relative to the Treatment of 
our Prisoners by Captain l'\)Ster in Canada. I am to request you will 
take the proper Steps to send one of them to (leneral Howe, and the other 
to Genl. Burgfoyne. I transmit also a third copy for your own use.' 

Should the United States of America give tiieir Sanction to the Jesuiti- 
cal and villanous Distinction which Cajjtain lH)Stcr adopts to justify his 
Conduct, there would he no End to butchering our Prisoners. They have 
thereft)rc very properly reprobated it, and in the genuine Spirit of Free- 
dom, resolved, that such Cruelty as shall be inllicted on Pri.soners in their 
Possession, by Savages or Foreigners taken into Pay by the King of 
Great Britain, shall l3e considered as done by his Orders, and Recourse 
be immediately had to Retaliation. It is to be hoped this Determination 
will have the desired Effect; and that for the future, such barbarous 
Scenes will never be acted under the Eye and Approbation of a British 
â€¢Officer. I say, under the Approbation of a British Officer : For there is 
the greatest Reason to believe, that Captain Foster engaged the Indians 
to join him, on the express Condition of giving up to them all such 
Prisoners as might fall into his Hands. His subsequent Conduct indeed 
renders this Conjecture more than probable.

PhiladelphiaJuly 15 1776 

My dear Sir 

.... The Truth is, I hardly know how to write without saying some- 
thing of our Canadian Afifairs ; and this is a Subject so thoroughly morti- 
fying to me, that I could wish totally to forget all that has past in that 
Country. Let me however just mention to you that Schuyler and Gates 
are to command the Troops to be employ'd there ; the former, while they 
are without, and the latter, while they are within the Bounds of Canada.^ 
Admitting both these Generals to have the military Accomplishments of 
Marlborough and Eugene, I cannot conceive that such a Disposition of 
them can be attended with any happy Effects, unless Harmony subsists 
between them. Alass! I fear this is not the Case â€” Already Disputes 
have arisen, which they have referrd to Congress! And though they 
appear to treat each other with a Politeness becoming their Rank, in my 
Mind, Altercations between Commanders who have Pretensions so nearly 
equal, I mean in Point of Command, forebode a Repetition of Misfor- 
tunes. I sincerely wish my Apprehensions may prove to be ground- 
less 

Our Declaration of Independency has given Vigor to the Spirits of the 
People. Had this decisive Measure been taken Nine Months ago, it is 
my opinion that Canada would at this time have been in our hands.^ But 
what does it avail to find fault with what is past. Let us do better for the 
future. We were more fortunate than expected in having 12 of the 13 
Colonies in favor of the all important Question. The Delegates of N. 
York were not impowered to give their Voice on either Side. Their Con- 
vention has since acceeded to the Declaration and publishd it even before 
they received it from Congress.* .... 

A Plan for Confederation has been brot into Congress wch I hope 
will be speedily digested and made ready to be laid before the several 
States for their approbation.^ A Committee has now under Consideration 
the Business of foreign Alliance. 

It is high time for us to have Ambassadors in foreign Courts. I fear 
we have already suffered too much by Delay. You know upon whom our 
Thoughts were turnd when you was with us.^ ....

it come through that channel. The usual method hitherto practised has 
been for the Convention of each Colony to give their Delegates instruc- 
tions to act and vote upon all and any important questions. And from 
the last letter we were favoured with from your body, you told us that 
you were not competent or authorized to give us instructions on that 
grand question ; ' nor have you been pleased to answer our letter of the 
2d instant, any otherwise than by your said resolve transmitted to the 
President. I think we were entitled to an answer. 

I am compelled, therefore, to declare, that it is against my judgment 
and inclination. As long as a door was left open for a reconciliation with 
Great Britain upon honourable and just terms, I was willing and ready 
to render my country all the service in my power, and for which purpose 
I was appointed and sent to this Congress ; but as you have, I presume, 
by that declaration, closed the door of reconciliation, I must beg leave 
to resign my seat as a Delegate from New York, and that I may be 
favoured with an answer and my dismission. 

I have the honour to be, gentlemen, your most obedient, humble servant, 

John Alsop.

Honhle Gentlemen, 

Since I had the Honour of addressing you, on the fourth of June, at 
which Time I transmitted sundry Resolves of Congress requesting you 
to call forth your Militia, our Aflfairs have assumed a much more serious 
Complexion.^ If we turn our Attention towards the Northern Depart- 
ment, we behold an Army reduced by Sickness, and obliged to flee before 
an Enemy of vastly superior Force. If we cast our Eyes to Head- 
Quarters, we see the British Army reinforced under Lord Howe, and 
ready to strike a Blow, which may be attended with the most fatal Con- 
sequences, if not timely resisted. The Situation of our Country at this 
Season, calls therefore for all the Vigour and Wisdom among us ; and if 
we do not mean to desert her at this alarming Crisis, it is high Time to 
rouse every Spark of Virtue; and forgetting all inferior Considerations, 
to exert ourselves in a Manner becoming Freemen. 

The Intelligence received this Day from General Washington, points 
out the absolute, the indispensible Necessity of sending forward all the

Sir 

.... Several vacancies having happened in our battalions, we are 
unable to have them filled for want of a list of the officers stating their 
seniority. We must beg the favor of you to furnish us with one. We 
received from Colo R. H. Lee a resolution of Convention recommending 
us to endeavor that the promotions of the officers be according to seniority 
without regard to regiments or companies this is the standing rule of 
promotion.' in one instance indeed the Congress have reserved to them- 
selves a right of departing from seniority ; that is where a person either 
out of the line of command, or in an inferior part of it has displayed 
eminent talents, most of the general officers have been promoted in this 
way. without this reservation the whole continent must have been sup- 
plied with general officers from the Eastern colonies where a large army 
was formed and officered before any other colony had occasion to raise 
troops at all and a number of experienced, able and valuable officers must 
have been lost to the public merely from the locality of their situation.

2 On June 12, in accordance with a resolution of the day before, Congress appointed 
a committee to prepare a plan of foreign treaties. The committee brought in a report 
July 18. The plan as reported is printed in the Journals, under that date; as amended 
it is found in the Journals, under Sept. 17. See no. 18, note 6, ante, and the Journals, 
July 20, Aug. 22, 27, 29, Sept. 17, 24, 26. Concerning the work of the committee, John 
Adams says in his Autobiography: 

" The committee for preparing the model of a treaty to be proposed to France, 
consisted of Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Franklin, Mr. John Adams, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. 
Robert Morris. When we met to deliberate on the subject, I contended for the same 
principles which I had before avowed and defended in Congress, namely, that we should 
avoid all alliance which might embarrass us in after times, and involve us in future 
European wars ; that a treaty of commerce which would operate as a repeal of the 
British acts of navigation so far as respected us, and admit France into an equal partici- 
pation of the benefits of our commerce, would encourage her manufactures, increase 
her exports of the produce of her soil and agriculture, extend her navigation and trade, 
augment her resources of naval power, raise her from her present deep humiliation, 
distress, and decay, and place her on a more equal footing with England, for the pro- 
tection of her foreign possessions; and maintaining her independence at sea, would be 
an ample compensation to France for acknowledging our independence, and for furnish- 
ing us, for our money, or upon credit for a time, with such supplies of necessaries as 
we should want, even if this conduct should involve her in a war ; if a war should ensue, 
which did not necessarily follow, for a bare acknowledgment of our independence, after 
we had asserted it, was not by the law of nations an act of hostility, which would be a 
legitimate cause of war. Franklin, although he was commonly as silent on committees 
as in Congress, upon this occasion, ventured so far as to intimate his concurrence with 
me in these sentiments ; though, as will be seen hereafter, he shifted them as easily as 
the wind ever shifted, and assumed a dogmatical tone in favor of an opposite system. 
The committee, after as much deliberation upon the subject as they chose to employ, 
appointed me to draw up a plan and report. Franklin had made some marks with a 
pencil against some articles in a printed volume of treaties, which he put into my hand. 
Some of these were judiciously selected, and I took them, with others which I found 
necessary, into the draught, and made my report to the committee at large, who, after 
a reasonable examination of it, agreed to report it. When it came before Congress, it 
occupied the attention of that body for several days. Many motions were made to 
insert in it articles of entangling alliance, of exclusive privileges, and of warranties of 
possessions ; and it was argued that the present plan reported by the committee held 
out no sufficient temptation to France, who would despise it and refuse to receive our 
Ambassador. It was chiefly left to me to defend my report, though I had some able 
assistance, and we did defend it with so much success that the treaty passed without one 
particle of alliance, exclusive privilege, or warranty." Works, II. 516. 

The discussion to which Adams refers doubtless took place Aug. 22-29. Cf- nos. 43, 
44, 50, 68, post. See also the Bibliographical Notes, in the Journals, VI. 1124. For some 
account of the further development of the model treaty and its extended use in treatj'

I should have answered my friend's obliging favor sooner, had I not 
thought that he would cheerfully excuse me until I had called the attention 
of the House effectually to the Support of his country. I trust this is in 
some measure now done. We have sent off Expresses to the Eastern 
States and to Maryland with very strong requests and in order to compel 
the Jerseys to afford a further assistance we have directed (not permitted) 
General Washington to call into your city from the flying camp 2000 men, 
judging, I should suppose truly that the people of that colony would not 
suffer to be overrun, but when convinced that they must contribute to the 
common cause, they would do it at once.^ ....

Ld. Howe is arrived in the Eagle Man o' War. The Reinforcmt is not 
arrived and I hope will never arrive. His Ldship sent a Flag o' truce 
a few days ago with Letters to Gen. Washington directed " to George 
Washington Esq." which were not received because his proper Title was 
not given him : since that some others have been sent to him with a similar 
Superscription and were for the same Reason not received. After this 
a flag was sent to Amboy with Letters to all the late Governors SÂ° of 
N. York inclos^ written Declarations containing his and his brother's 
(Genl Howe) appointmt as Commissioners to receive the Submission 
of the Colonies or private Persons and grant Pardons agreeable to the 
late act of the Brit. Parliament, and a number of Letters principally from 
Friends in London to Friends here placing the Character of the Howes 
in the most amiable point of View, and recommending Reconciliation with 
G. Britain. These Letters were all sent by the commanding Officer at 
Amboy to G. Washington, and were transmitted by him to Congress, and

when the Letters were bro't in, but was sent for. When he entered, his 
Letters were dehvered to him scaled. He opened them, looked over them, 
and handed them to the President desiring him to read them. They were 
according'' read to Congress and contained much the same Sentiments 
with those to Friends, as did that to Mr Stockton, who is a Member of 
Congress, and who was treated and behaved in the same manner that 
Dr Franklin did. As the Farmer is in the Jersey at the Head of his 
Battalion, his Letter is kept sealed by the President until he shall retufn 
and receive it in Congress." The Letters to the late Governors and the 
Declarations are ordered to be printed to let the People see upon what 
Terms Reconciliation is proposed to them : â€” Odi Danaos, etiam Dona 
fcrentes: but when what some People, Tories, may call the Olive-plant 
is handed to us at the point of the Bayonet, or is hurled to us from the 
Mouths of Canon, if possible I should more than hate it. The Truth is 
the Door is shut, and it would now be in vain, to talk of any sort of 
Alliance with Britain but a Commercial One. We have been driven into 
a Declar^ of Independency and must forget our former Love for our 
British Brethren. The Sword must determine our Quarrel.' ....

Doctor Franklin and I have been favoured with your letter of the 
14th instant. At his request I write this answer for him and myself. 
I believe the Congress have no particular views which they would wish 
to accomplish at the ensuing Treaty. Their intention and their earnest 
desire is that Peace and Friendship may be preserved and cultivated 
between the United States and the Indian Tribes. Presents are the most 
prevailing arguments that can be used with the Savages for this purpose.^

Dear Sir 

I received your obliging letter of the i8th. yesterday in Congress, and 
shou'd have been tempted to have laid the enclosure immediately before 
the House, had not a letter from the same person on the same subject 
and in a similar style addressed to J. Kinsey Esqr of New Jersey, been 
read in Congress the day before, the Temper of the House was plain and

you may judge what it was, when I tell you, the only enquiry that letter 
produced was, ? how it got to Mr. Kinseys hands. ^ 

I am sorry to say there are some amongst us that cannot bear the 
thought of reconciliation on any terms, to these men all propositions of 
the kind, sound like high Treason against the States and I really believe 
they wou'd sooner punish a Man for this Crime than for bearing arms 
against us. 

I cannot help Condemning this disposition as it must be founded in 
keen resentment or on interested Views whereas we ought to have the 
Interest of our Country and the Good of Mankind to Act as the Main 
Spring in all our Public Conduct. I think with you that if the Com- 
missioners have any propositions to make they ought to be heard, shou'd 
they disclose powers different from what we imagine them to be Vested 
with, and an inclination to employ those powers favourably for America, 
it is our duty to attend to such offers, weigh well the Consequences of 
every determination we come to and in short to lay aside all prejudices, 
resentments and sanguine Notions of our own Strength in order that 
Reason may influence and Wisdom guide our Councils. If the Admiral 
and General are really desirous of a Conference I think and hope they will 
address our General properly, this may be expected if they have powers 
beyond granting pardons ; if they have not, it is Idle for them to solicit 
any intercourse as no good can possibly arise to them or their Cause from 
it, but on our parts I think good Policy requires that we shou'd hear all 
they have to say. I am not for making any Sacrifice of Dignity ; but still 
I wou'd hear them if possible, because, if they can offer Peace on admissi- 
ble terms I believe the great Majority of America wou'd still be for 
accepting it. If they can only offer Pardons and that is fully ascertained 
it will firmly Unite all America in their exertions to support the Indepen- 
dence they have declared, and it must be obvious to everybody that our 
United Efforts will be absolutely necessary this being the case ? why 
shoud we fear to Treat of Peace or to hear the Commissioners on that 
Subject, if they can offer terms that are advantageous and honorable 
for this Country, let us meet them, if they cannot, We are not in a situa- 
tion or temper to ask or receive pardons, and all who 'dont mean to stoop 
to this Ignominious submission will consequently take up their Arms with 
a determination to Conquer or die. If they offer or desire a Conference 
and we reject it, those who are already dissatisfyed will become more so 
others will follow their example and we may expect daily greater disunion 
and defection in every part of these States, at least such are my appre- 
hensions on this Subject. I have uniformly Voted against and opposed 
the declaration of Independance because in my poor oppinion it was an 
improper time and will neither promote the interest or redound to the 
honor of America, for it has caused division when we wanted Union, 
and will be ascribed to very different principles than those, which ought' 
to give rise to such an Important measure

Sir: 

The bearer, Mr. Joseph Belton, some time since petitioned the Congress 
for encouragement to destroy the enemy's ships of war by some con- 
trivances of his invention. They came to no resolution on his petition; 
and, as they appear to have no great opinion of such proposals, it is not 
easy, in the multiplicity of business before them, to get them to bestow 
any part of their attention on his request. He is now desirous of trying 
his hand on the ships that are gone up the North River; and, as he pro- 
poses to work entirely at his own expense, and only desires your counte- 
nance and permission, I could not refuse his desire of a line of introduc- 
tion to you, the trouble of which I beg you to excuse. As he appears to 
be a very ingenious man, I hope his project may be attended with 
success.^

first ser., W. 650, 654. It v^'as only a short time after Belton went to New York on 
this mission that David Bushnell put his submarine, the American Turtle, to the test 
in an attempt to destroy the British fleet. An account of this affair is related by David 
Humphreys in his Life of General Israel Putnam, pp. 123-129. See also Am. Jour, of

has been learned concerning the outcome of Belton's application to Washington, but it

spirit, as I think will now be the case.^ 

The Convention here have taken on them the government of this

Dear Sir: 

I have your favour of the 6th instant. In answer to the part of it 
respecting the commissions, I can only say, I am perpetually dunning the 
President to send them. If any alteration in the wages of the commission 
officers, they will be higher; so there can be no difficulty with them. If 
any are lowered, it will be the mates, midshipmen, coopers, sailmakers, 
and perhaps some other of the petty officers, and perhaps boatswain, 
carpenter, and gunner. If the three last are altered, it will be but a 
trifle â€” say one dollar.^ .... 

I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you so soon as I hoped, as some 
very important matters are now on the tapis, which I want to hear 
debated; besides, I would fain have the marine matters settled before I 
leave this. I therefore think it will be the latter end of August before I 
shall be able to enjoy that satisfaction which I have flattered myself would 
be much earlier.' ....

38. The President of Congress (John Hancock) to the 
President of South Carolina (John Rutledge).^ 

Philadelphia July 24th. 1776. 
Sir: 

The Congress being of Opinion, that the Service of the United States 
will be promoted by taking into Pay a Number of Troops, in the State 
of South Carolina, who are to act either as Infantry or light Horse, as 
Occasion may require, have come to the enclosed Resolves, which I do 
myself the Honour of transmitting in Obedience to their Commands. 

In Consideration that these Troops will go through more than ordinary 
Duty, and be put to greater Expence than others, the Congress have 
augmented their Pay in Proportion. 

I have delivered blank Commissions to the Delegates of your State.^ 



3 The writer of this letter was probably Benjamin Rush. That it was one of the 
new delegates of Pennsylvania is evidenced by a reference (in a passage omitted here) 
to Pennsylvania as " our State ". The style of the letter definitely suggests Rush. The 
election of the delegates by the Pennsylvania convention took place July 20, and the 
credentials were presented to Congress the same day (see the Journals). Rush himself 
says : " On the 20th of July I took my seat in Congress in consequence of an appoint- 
ment received from the Convention that met to form a constitution for Pennsylvania. 
A few days afterwards I subscribed a copy upon parchment of the declaration of inde- 
pendence." {Memorial, p. 92). Strangely enough the Journals record the appointment of 
Rush on a committee July 17. An examination of the " Rough Journal " shows that the 
names of the committee are entered in a different ink from that used in recording the reso- 
lution, and that the resolution itself has been altered by erasures (chiefly with a knife) 
and by emendations in the same ink with which the names are written. The original 
entry appears to have been " that it be referred to the committee appointed [on the mis- 
carriages in Canada?]". It would appear therefore that on a subsequent day, after 
Rush had taken his seat, Congress revised its action and appointed a new committee, and 
that this revision was recorded only by an alteration in the original resolution. In this 
way Rush is made to appear to have been in Congress three days prior to his election.

Philadelphia 2Stli Julv 1776 
Sir 

Immediately upon llic Receipt of your Letter we apjilied to Congress 
for Permission to order the Kast India Tea now in your stores to be sold 
and to direct the Produce thereof to be carried into the Colony Treasury 
to be appropriated in such manner as your Assembly should jndg^e rij^ht. 
In Consequence of this Application a Debate of some Lcnj^th ensued in 
which the House indicatccl a strone;- Inclination to lay their Hands upon 
the Profits which should arise from the Sale either for the Use of the 
Continent at large or to be carried into a Fund to reimburse those Col- 
onies whose Property should be seized in England There appeared 
neither Reason nor Justice in these Measures and we endeavoured to 
obviate the objections which were made to the Application and to answer 
the Arguments which had been advanced against it. 

We observed That this Property should be looked upon as belonging 
to the King of Great-Britain and not to the East-India Company as the 
latter had been divested of it both by the Seizure which the Custom- 
House ofificers had made of it and by the indemnification of the Parlia- 
ment, that the Congress had therefore no more Right to apply this Tea 
to the use of the Continent at large than they had to dispose of the Cannon 
in our Forts or the Crown Lands within the Limits of the Colony â€” But 
that if it was the East-India Company's Property they had occasioned 
such an Expence to the State of Carolina as to justify them fully in the 
Seizures. That it w-ould be repugnent [sic] to the Principles of Justice 
to insist that this Tea should be sold for the Benefit of those whose Prop- 
erty had been or might be seized in England in Exclusion of those whose 
Property had been seized in America and that it would be impracticable 
to bring every species of Loss into one common Account That the 
Seizure of Property had been a common misfortune of which as well as 
of public Expences we have had our full Proportion and that therefore it 
would be injurious to our State not to be permitted to make use of the 
Advantage in this Instance which the Possession of the Tea had given. 
It was confessed that we had a Right to sell it if we chose and apply the 
Profits as we pleased But as we had asked the opinion of the House 
upon the Subject we should now be governed by the Disposition which 
they should think proper to make and that they should take Time to con- 
sider of it. The Delegates being by this Time fully convinced that there 
were many in the House who wished to dispose of it in a Manner injuri- 
ous to the Interest and the Right of our State agreed to withdraw the 
Motion for which they obtained the Leave of Congress and we now with 
one Voice advise you to recommend to your assembly immediately to sell 
the same and apply the Profits thereof to Colonial Purposes. Indeed 
we were not a little surprised at your requesting us to lay the same before

having been for sometime under the Consideration of Congress, have 
prevented my regularly Replying to your Letters, and forwarding your

the late Agents, and at their insisting on Acting, untill your Commission 
should arrive; Sir, the very moment you reed my first letter under the 
Sanction of Congress, informing you of your Appointment as Agent, that 
very moment they were Superceeded, and were Accountable to you for 
all monies then in their hands belonging to the United States, in Conse- 
quence of any Captures, and Sales of Continental Property. However as 
I am always dispos'd to Accommodate matters, and to put things on a 
stable footing, I now enclose your Commission, and now not only Au- 
thorise, but Direct, you to call upon the Gentlemen, who have hitherto 
Acted as Agents, to render their Acco[u]nts to you, and to pay what 
monies they may have in their hands belonging to the Public to you, and 
to cease all further proceedings in that Department, the sd. Accts. with the 
vouchers to be Transmitted to me, to be laid before the Marine Com-

of such monies reed, and to be accountable therefor. And the former 
Agents are hereby directed immediately on your Application to Render 
their Accotts. and pay the monies they may have in their hands to you ; I 
wish to settle this matter as early as possible, for altho' their Conduct is 
highly Reprehensible yet I would gladly pass it over without a public men- 
tion, but with respect to the Arms, order'd by Congress to be sent to Genl. 
Washington, and which Mr. Glover mentions he without Consulting you 
had dispos'd of among the Troops, in his Brothers Regiment, I must 
insist that you immediately carry that Resolution into Execution, and 
that the Arms be forwarded to the Genl. as at first order'd by Congress,

and plagued with two knotty problems in politics. You love to pick a 
political bone. So I will even throw it to you. 

If a confederation should take place, one great question is, how we 
shall vote. Whether each colony shall count one? or whether each shall 
have a weight in proportion to its number, or wealth, or exports and 
imports, or a compound ratio of all ? Another is, whether Congress shall 
have authority to limit the dimensions of each colony, to prevent those, 
which claim by charter, or proclamation, or commission to the south 
sea, from growing too great and powerful, so as to be dangerous to 
the rest? 

Shall I write you a sheet upon each of these questions? When you

I may.^ ....

whence hostilities may successfully be carried into the bosom of the

Philadelphia, July 20 [30?], 1776.^ 
Dear Page, 

.... I would not advise that the French gentlemen should come here. 
We have so many of that country, and have been so much imposed on, 
that the Congress begins to be sore on that head.^ Besides there is no 
prospect of raising horse this way. But if you approve of the Chevalier 
de St. Aubin, why not appoint him yourselves, as your troops of horse 
are Colonial not Continental ? 

The 8th battalion w^ill no doubt be taken into Continental pay from 
the date you mention. So also will be the two written for lately to come 
to the Jersies.* The 7th should have been moved in Congress long e'er 
now, but the muster roll sent us by Mr. Yates was so miserably defective 
that it would not have been received, and would have exposed him. 
We therefore desired him to send one more full, still giving it the same 
date, and I enclosed him a proper form.^ .... 

Having declined serving here the next year, I shall be with you at the 
first session of our assembly. I purpose to leave this place the nth of 
August, having so advised Mrs. Jefferson by last post, and every letter

In a letter to Samuel Johnston, July 24, Hewes says : " Mr. Hooper came to town last 
evening" (Pa. Mag. of Hist, and Biog., XLHI. 263). He probably took his seat in 
Congress the 24th, as the letter of the North Carolina council, was presented on that day.

2 There are several evidences that the date of this letter as found in the printed 
texts is incorrect : First, Page's letter to Jefferson (Library of Congress, Jefferson 
Papers, second ser., LXV. 8), to which this is a reply, is clearly dated July 20; second, the 
statement in the letter concerning the two Virginia battalions " written for lately to come 
to the Jersies " refers to a resolution of Congress July 20 ; third, a paragraph, omitted 
here, evidently was written in the light of Washington's letter of July 27, read in Congress 
July 29. The date of the letter should probably therefore be July 30.

Your letter of the 14th instant followed me to this city, and your other

gress, to give my little assistance to the framing a Confederacy, and a 
plan for a foreign alliance â€” both of them subjects of the utmost impor- 
tance, and which, in my judgment, demand immediate despatch. The 
Confederacy has engaged our close attention for a week. Three great 
difficulties occur : Representation, the mode of voting, and the claims to 
the South Sea. The whole might, in my opinion, be settled, if candour, 
justice, and the real interests of America were attended to. We do not 
all see the importance, nay, the necessity, of a Confederacy. We shall 
remain weak, distracted, and divided in our councils; our strength. will 
decrease ; we shall be open to all the arts of the insidious Court of Britain, 
and no foreign Court \\\\\ attend to our applications for assistance before 
we are confederated. What contract will a foreign State make with us,

Philadelphia 2d. August 1776 
Sir 

I am particularly instructed by Congress to answer that part of your 
letter of 29th. Ulto. directed to the Board of War, which Relates to the 
filling up Vacancies in the Army. The Congress are Concern'd to find that 
an opinion is Entertain'd that greater Confidence has been plac'd in, and 
larger powers given to other Commanders in that respect, than to your- 
self. They have in no instance except in the late Api^ointment of General 
Gates to the Command in Canada, parted with the power of filling up 
Vacancies. The great Confusion and many Disorders prevalent in that 
Army and its Distance, induc'd Congress to lodge such a power in that 
General, for the limited space of three months, and only during his Con- 
tinuance in Canada. Should Congress ever empower its Generals to fill 
up the Vacancies in the Army, they know of no one in whom they would 
so soon Repose a Trust of such Importance as in yourself ; but future 
Generals may make a bad use of it. The Danger of the Precedent, not 
any suspicion of their present Commander in Chief, prompts them to 
Retain a Pow-er, that, by you. Sir, might be exercised w-ith the greatest 
public Advantage.^ ....

Honoured Sir, 

Permit us, thro' you, to address the lionourable body in which you 
preside, and inform them that we were favoured with their two last 
letters by Mr Hooper, and have seized the earliest, and most probable 
method to carry the contents of them into execution. We have stated to 
the continental congress, with all the energy we are capable of, the present 
distress and necessitous State of our Province, and the means which may 
tend most effectually to relieve it. We have been as fortunate as your 
most Sanguine expectations, and the inclosed Resolve will convince you, 
that North Carolina bears no inconsiderable weight in the favour of the 
Continental Congress. The readiness which they discover upon all 
occasions to comply with the just requisitions of our State, evince that 
they entertain a grateful sense of our patriotick exertions, and wish to 
furnish to us every inducement to persist in a conduct from which we 
have to expect liberty, peace, and happiness.^ ....

Opinion that one Man ^ must be removd to some other Department to 
put an End to our Misfortunes there. This has been attempted and urgd, 
but has hitherto been impracticable. A little Time may perhaps unravel 
Mysteries and convince Gentlemen that they have been under certain 
Prejudices to which the wisest Men are lyable. It appears to me very 
extraordinary that Mr L should insist upon acting after being apprizd

Since writing the foregoing I have turnd to the printed Journals of 
Congress and find that on the 17 July 1775 Walter Livingston Esqr was 
appointed " Commissary of Stores and Provisions for the New York 
Department during the present Campaign." Upon what Grounds then 
does he speak of himself as vested by Congress with full Powers to act 
//// revoked. The last Campaign which limitted his power to act, is 
finishd. Under what Pretence can he be supported by his Patron, espec- 
ially since by the Resolution of Congress of the 8th of July last, you have 
" full Power to supply both Armies, that upon the Lakes as well as that 
at New York, and also to appoint and employ such Persons under you 
and to remove any Deputy Commissary as you shall think proper and 
expedient," and for this express Reason " it being absolutely necessary 
that the supply of both Armies should be under one Direction.Â® Has not 
General S seen this Resolution? or, if he has seen it. Does he judge that 
the supply of the two Armies should be under different Directions, and 
undertake to order the Matter accordingly. If the Persons whom you 
send to act under you in the Northern Army, are confined and limited 
by any other Person after they arrive there, unless by order of Congress, 
and without giving you Notice in Case such order should be made, We 
must expect a Repetition of the most mortifying Disappointment. Upon 
my Word, I think it your Duty to remonstrate this either to the Com- 
mander in Chief or the Congress. The former I should suppose you 
\vd prefer.

Delaware and Supposed by this time got in. This days post is not yet 
Come in from New- York. It is past his Usual time of Coming, and there- 
fore Imagined there will be something important, which delayed him. 
I wish it may be Good. The Delaware [battalion] came to town this 
Morning and there passed an Order of Congress Yesterday Morning for 
Captain Darby and his Company now at Lewis, to Come up and join the 
Battalion, or at least to follow them,^ for as Congress have now Got 
Arms, I imagine t'hey will not stay long here. Let not the Contents of 
my other letter be seen by any, Unless a friend in whom you can confide.

59. John Adams to William Heath.* 

Philadelphia, Aug. 3, 1776. 
Dear Sir: 

Yours of the 20th ult. is before me 

Congress has not determined to liave no regard to the hue of succession 
in promotions, but only that this hnc shall not be an invariable rule; 
eaeteris f^arihus, the line will be pursued, but they mean to reserve a right 
of distinguishing extraordinary merit, or demerit.- This rule may be 
abu.sed. But is it not necessary? all good things are liable to abuse. 
I am afraid, nay I know it will be abused in particular instances. But 
if we make the succession an invariable rule, will not the abuse be greater? 

Is it not common in the British Army to promote junior officers over 
the heads of their supcriours ? nay even officers in the same regiment, and 
on the same commaml? I have been told of several instances. This 
however is wrong 



By some expressions in the close of your letter, I conclude you were 
not perfectly satisfied with a late promotion. Be assured. Sir, if that was 
raising a junior officer, over the head of any superiour, it was not con- 
sidered in that light by the gentlemen who did it ; the person promoted 
was thought to be the oldest Brigadier, and intituled to advancement by 
the line of succession. And it is my opinion he would have been made a 
Major General much sooner if his experience had not been thought indis- 
pensible in the Adjutant General's Department.^

Philadelphia, Aug. 5, 1776. 
Dear Page, 

.... The Congress having had reason to suspect the Six nations 
intended war, instructed their commissioners to declare to them peremp- 
torily that if they chose to go to war with us, they should be at liberty to 
remove their families out of our settlements, but to remember that they 
should not only never more return to their dwellings on any terms but 
that we would never cease pursuing them with war w^hile one remained 
on the face of the earth ; and moreover, to avoid equivocation, to let them 
know they must recall their young men from Canada, or we should con- 
sider them as acting against us nationally. This decisive declaration 
produced an equally decisive act on their part ; they have recalled their 
young men, and are stirring themselves with anxiety to keep their people

cheerfully and unanimously to accept of his resignation, with some severe 
and cutting reflections on him for his conduct; which were all sent to 
Congress.^ I believe his boarding with our friend Wharton has been no 
advantage to him; possibly, he was obliged to resign his seat as a previous

just occasion for it.^ You mention that you had wrote me. be assured

Northern Army â€” the distance of that Station, the variety of Impediments 
which Sickness, Climate, the failure of duty in officers and men have 
thrown in the way have been insurmountable even to the most spirited 
and well meant intentions of this Congress. Unless some measures are 
immediately taken to strengthen your post I augur that Burgoygn will 
soon set foot in Albany. The Stars in their courses seem to fight against

Subject, and lent Them the Letter in Consequence of which They brot

.... The Declaration of Independence meets with universal approba-

their country. 

Most of our frigates are launched in the different provinces, and are 
fitting for sea with all the expedition in our power. They are fine ships 
and will be capable of good service. Our small privateers and continental 
armed vessels have already had great success, as the papers will show you ; 
and by abstaining from trade ourselves, while we distress that of our 
enemies, we expect to make their men-of-war weary of their unprofitable 
and hopeless cruises, and their merchants sick of a contest in which so 
much is risked and nothing gained. The forming a Navy is a capital

increasing it very considerably." ....

capt Biddle had made prize of, by the Cerberus frigate 

By a letter which he found means to convey he informs that " he is 
used worse than he ever thought one englishman could use another â€” that 
he was sent before the mast with the rest, but upon refusing to do duty 
was given under the charge of three boatswains mates and expects the 
gangway soon as he is daily threatened." ' 

An Order is this moment pass'd for calling General Lee from the 
southward, and tomorrow is appointed for electing a number of major 
generals and brig"" generals.* 

I am Sir Your very Hum^ servt.

You will please to mention the matter of Lieut. Josiah as real informa- 
tion, but not discover that it was by Letter, as it may prove injurious, in 
case he is not exchang'd.

My dear Sir, 

.... I have great reason to believe that France would readily listen 
to an application from the united States of amcrica, but when we shall be 
confederated States, I know not. I am afraid the Day is far distant, 
three great DiHiculties occur â€” The Mode of Voting, whether by Colonies, 
or by an equal Representation ; The Rule by which each Colony is to pay 
its Quota, and the Claim of several Colonies to extend to the South Seas. 
a considerable Diversity of opinion prevails on each Head. '^Fhe Con- 
federacy is to be transmitted to each State for their Concurrence. 

It is probable I'^ance will not enter into an alliance with Us before we 
have confederated, if ever we do, it will take a considerable Time to 
effect it, and the opportunity may be lost of striking some great and 
decisive blow." ....

We wrote you yesterday " by express to General Lee with dispatches 
requesting his immediate return to the Eastern Colonies.* We then men- 
tioned to you that Congress in ordet to encourage the completion of the 
Continental Regiments had ofifered a considerable bounty to all non com- 
missioned Officers and soldiers who would enlist for the space of three 
years. Congress are deeply impressed with the necessity of making 
enlistments if possible during the War but at any rate for the space of 
three years, as frequent enlistments prevent soldiers ever becoming expert 
in discipline and often put it in their power to quit their Stations at a 
time when their Services are most necessary for the publick Safety.* We 
recollect that our State hath given a bounty of 40s. to every man who has 
engaged in the Continental Regts. raised in No. Carolina. By way of 
Oeconomy and to save that Bounty to the Colony in part by making it a 
continental charge We would propose that 5 dollars more be given to 
every non commissioned Officer and soldier already enlisted who will 
engage for the space of the War and if that cannot be effected, for a 
limited time. We wish a longer at any rate than three years, tho that will

Fellow and the most illiberal Abuse thrown out against him in Congress, 
such as I think totally inconsistent with their Honor and Justice to suffer 
but so it is ; nor has the author escaped severe Remarks by the Friends of 
Wooster but the former undauntedly persisted in his Reflections, and has 
fixed a deep Prejudice against him in a majority; tho not a single Charge 
can be supported against him. and he has been honorably acquitted by a 
Com'*, whose Report by address etc. has been yet kept of [f] and recom- 
itted however on the Tryal for Maj Gs. he carried six votes twice agst.

Canada (see the Journals, July 19, 30, 31, Aug. 3, 5, 10) that the incident occurred which 

Benjamin Rush relates in his Memorial (p. 104) : " In a debate in which Mr. 

criminated the New England troops as the principal cause of the failure of the expedi- 
tion into Canada in 1775, he [John Adams] said, 'the cause of the failure of that expedi- 
tion was chiefly to be ascribed to the imprudence of the gentleman from Marj-land who 
had fomented jealousies and quarrels between the troops from the New England and 
Southern States, in his visit to Canada, and (said Mr. Adams) if he were now pene- 
trated, as he ought to be, with a sense of his improper and wicked conduct, he would 
fall down upon his knees, on this floor, and ask our forgiveness. He would afterwards 
retire with shame, and spend the remainder of his life in sackcloth and ashes, deploring 

the mischief he had done his country.' " " Mr. " could scarcely be any other than

it but suffer no Copies. Two or 3 Articles had been considered in Congress as Congress 
and acted upon. And they were proceeding upon the rest when Col Whipple came away."

gentlemen from the Southern and Middle States, and of many from New England. 
I thought, however, that Hopkins had done great service, and made an important 
beginning of naval operations 

" It appeared to me that the Commodore was pursued and persecuted by that anti-New- 
England spirit which haunted Congress in many other of their proceedings, as well as 
in this case and that of General Wooster. I saw nothing in the conduct of Hopkins, 
which indicated corruption or want of integrity. Experience and skill might have been 
deficient in several particulars ; but where could we find greater experience or skill ? 
I knew of none to be found. The other captains had not so much, and it was afterwards 
found they had not more success. I therefore entered into a full and candid investiga- 
tion of the whole subject ; considered all the charges a:id all the evidence, as well as his 
answers and proofs ; and exerted all the talents and eloquence I had, in justifying him 
where he was justifiable, and excusing him where he was excusable ", etc. John Adams,

T cannot give you any acceptaMe News. Congress are yet bussie at 
all Intervals of croiuling Business, in Selling a Confederation, it seems 
to labour hard, and I fear a jx^rniancnt one will never be settled ; tho the 
most material articles are I think got thro', so as to give great offence to 
some, but to my Satisfaction, the bold and sonorous Cha.se (and some 
or all his Colleagues) solemnly protest against the Taxation Article etc. 
and declare that they consider Maryland as having no further Concern 
in it. and that his Colony never will nor never shall agree to it. They are 
all gone home, except Mr Stone, to attend (they say) their Convention 
which sits this Day. most of the Southern Colonies are as uneasie as 
they, but dont scold quite so hard.* 

What will be the event of Things God only knows. If we were to view 
only the rage and Strength of our Enemies, our Divisions and the wicked- 
ness of the People, We might well despair, but they are wicked also, 
their cause is certainly most unjust, the Judge of all the Earth will do

medal he proposes, Liberty, with her spear and pileus, leaning on General 
Washington. The British fleet in Boston harbor with all their sterns 
towards the town, the American troops marcliing in. For the seal, he 
l)roposes. The arms of the several nations from whence America has

.shield. On one side of them. Liberty with her pileus, on the other, a rifler 
in his uniform, with his rifle gim in one hand, and his tomahawk in the 
other. This dress and these troops with this kind of armor being peculiar 
to America, unless the dress was known to the Romans. Dr. Franklin 
showed me yesterday a book, containing an account of the dresses of all 
the Roman soldiers, one of which appeared exactly like it. This M. du 
Simitierc is a verv curious man. He has begun a collection of materials 
for a history of this revolution. He begins with the first advices of the 
tea ships. He cuts out of the newspapers every scrap of intelligence, and 
every piece of speculation, and pastes it upon clean paper, arranging them 
under the head of that State to which they belong, and intends to bind 
them up in volumes. He has a list of every speculation and pamphlet 
concerning independence and another of those concerning forms of 
government. 

Doctor F. proposes a device for a seal. Moses lifting up his wand,

Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs, from whom we claim the honor of

Virtue pointing to her rugged mountain on one hand, and persuading 
him to ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery paths of pleasure, wantonly 
reclining on the ground, displaying the charms both of her eloquence and 
person, to seduce him into vice. But this is too complicated a group for 
a seal or medal, and it is not original

Orders, hath been heard in his Defence. Congress Resolved that his

Sir: 

.... I fear the Confederation will not be finished in time to be laid 
before our Assembly at their next sitting. Last week passed without 
looking at it.^ Other affairs have taken up the whole time. Near two 
days were taken up about Commodore Hopkins ; and we had the pleasure 
to be for the greatest part of that time entertained by the eloquence of 
some of our Southern brethren, particularly that polite speaker, Middle- 
ton. The Congress at last found Hopkins guilty of not paying proper 
attention to his orders, and have ordered him to be censured. Thus 
stands that affair at present.^ ....

2 Samuel Adams left Congress Aug. 12. See no. 72, note 3, ante. On Aug. 20 Con- 
gress went into committee of the whole on the Confederation. In his Autobiography, 
under that date, John Adams rails at the brevity of the record in the Journals : " Thus we 
see the whole record of this momentous transaction. No motions recorded, no yeas and 
nays taken down, no alterations proposed, no debates preserved, no names mentioned ; ail 
in profound secrecy. Nothing suffered to transpire, no opportunity to consult constituents : 
no room for advice or criticisms in pamphlets, papers, or private conversation. I was 
very uneasy under all this, but could not avoid it. In the course of this confederation a 
few others were as anxious as myself. Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, upon one 
occasion, moved that the debates should be public, the doors opened, galleries erected, 
or an adjournment made to some public building, where the people might be accom- 
modated. Mr. John Adams seconded the motion, and supported it with zeal. But 
no! neither party was willing; some were afraid of divisions among the people; 
but more were afraid to let the people see the insignificant figures they made in that 
assembly. Nothing, indeed, was less understood abroad, among the people, than the 
real constitution of Congress, and the characters of those who conducted the business 
of it. The truth is, the motions, plans, debates, amendments, which were every day 
brought forward, in those committees of the whole house, if committed to writing, 
would be very voluminous ; but they are lost forever. The preservation of them, indeed, 
might, for any thing I recollect, be of more curiosity than use." Works, III. 69. 

Adams had before him when writing his Autobiography (1805) only the public 
Journals, the secret Journals not having been published until 1821. The same error of 
misapprehension is in part responsible for frequent criticisms of the method of keeping 
the record of proceedings. 

It has not been discovered when the motion of James Wilson, referred to by Adams, 
was made. The rule of closed doors was adopted Sept. 6, 1774, and May 11, I775- Cf.

3 David Wooster. See the Journals, Aug. 17. In his Autobiography {Works, 
III. 67) Adams says, concerning the vote to agree to the committee report on Wooster: 

" But not, however, without a great struggle. In this instance, again, as in many 
others, wliere the same anti-New-England spirit which pursued Commodore Hopkins, 
persecuted General Wooster, I had to contend with the whole host of their enemies, 
and with the utmost anxiety, and most ardous efforts, was scarcely able to preserve them 
from disgrace and ruin, which Wooster had merited even less than Hopkins. In 
Wooster's case, there was a manifest endeavor to lay upon him the blame of their own 
misconduct, in Congress, in embarrassing and starving the war in Canada. Wooster 
was calumniated for incapacity, want of application, and even for cowardice, without 
a color of proof of either. The charge of cowardice he soon confuted, by a glorious 
and voluntary sacrifice of his life, which compelled his enemies to confess he was a 
hero." Cf. vol. I. of these Letters, no. 630; also nos. 64, 71, ante, and no. 85, post. 

* Esek Hopkins. See the Journals, Aug. 15, 16. 
"Although this resolution of censure was not in my opinion demanded by justice, and 
consequently was inconsistent with good policy, as it tended to discourage an officer, and 
diminish his authority, by tarnishing his reputation, yet, as it went not so far as to 
cashier him. which had been the object intended by the spirit that dictated the prosecu- 
tion, I had the satisfaction to think that I had not labored wholly in vain in his defence."

- The date of this letter is probably Aug. 19. That it could not have been earlier 
than Sunday the 18th is evident from the reference to the Hopkins case: " Most of the 
last week was taken up in trying old Hopkins." It could not have been after the session 
of Aug. 20, for on that day consideration of the Confederation, which had been suspended 
since the 8th, was resumed. The reference to the Articles of War would seem to have 
in view the proceedings of Aug. 19. The letter bears the endorsement, " Edward Rut- 
ledge Esqr Reed Augt. 1776 ".

Abilities entitled him to. his Friends threaten'd us with his Resig-nation 
if he was passed by, this was conclusive with some of us, but he has not yet 
gratified our Expectations, and we begin to fear that his Attachment to 
1 20 Dollars a Month will prevent the good work.* We found some diffi- 
culty in getting Clynton made a general, Phil : Livingston proposed him 
and I advocated his Promotion ; it was confessed on all Hands that he had 
done more and suffered more than Mc:Dougal, but a Mr. Varnum of 
Rhode-Island and Maxwell of Jerseys were opposed to him, our Exertions 
however prevailed. I shall be doubly fortunate if by my Endeavours two 
valuable officers can be rewarded. You who have served so long in Con- 
gress, will confess, it is not often that we do much good in one day. Most 
of the last Week was taken up in trying old Hopkins, for a Breach of 
Orders, the Fact was clearly proved, his Excuses were trifling to the last 
Degree, to say the least of them, the Congress in opposition to the Eastern 
Colonies found him guilty and have censured him for his Conduct : Some 
of us Pressed his Removal from the Command, but a tenderness or rather 
weakness for his Brother, and an Opinion that he would resign in Con- 
sequence of the Thunder of the House, obstructed the passing of the 
Motion. I wish he would resign, for I am satisfied that he is totally unfit 
for the Department, and that we shall be disgraced so long as he shall 
continue at the Head of our naval Affairs.^ We are doing everything in 
our power to reform the Vices of the Army and put the Forces under 
better Regulations than they have yet been. The Committee of which 
you Jefferson Adams and I were Members who were desired to revise 
the Articles of War and bring in such Amendments as they thought 
proper, have reported to the House the British Articles as far as local 
Circumstances will admit, and the Congress is in a fair way of adopting 
them.Â® If we can carry them thro' compleatly it will have a most happy

8 The so-called committee on spies was appointed June 5 (" to consider what is 
proper to be done with persons giving inteUigence to the enemy", etc.). The duty of 
preparing articles of war was assigned to the committee June 14. It brought in a report 
on Aug. 7, and the articles were further considered Aug. 13, 19, and Sept. 19, and 
adopted Sept. 20. Concerning this report, John Adams says in his Autobiography 
(Works, III. 68) : "This report was made by me and Mr. Jefferson, in consequence of 
a letter from General Washington, sent by Colonel Tudor, Judge Advocate-General, 
representing the insufficiency of the articles of war, and requesting a revision of them. 
Mr. John Adams and Mr. Jefferson were appointed a committee to hear Tudor, and 
revise the articles. It was a very difficult and unpopular subject, and I observed to 
Jefferson, that whatever alteration we should report with the least energy in it, or the 
least tendency to a necessary discipline of the army, would be opposed with as much 
vehemence, as if it were the most perfect ; we might as well, therefore, report a complete 
system at once, and let it meet its fate. Something perhaps might be gained. There 
was extant one system of articles of war which had carried two empires to the head of 
mankind, the Roman and the British ; for the British articles of war were only a 
literal translation of the Roman. It would be in vain for us to seek in our own inven- 
tions, or the records of warlike nations, for a more complete system of military discipline. 
It was an observation founded in undoubted facts, that the prosperity of nations had 
been in proportion to the discipline of their forces by sea and land ; I was, therefore, 
for reporting the British articles of war, totidem z'crbis. Jefferson; in those days, never 
failed to agree with me, in every thing of a political nature, and he very cordially con- 
curred in this. The British articles of war were, accordingly, reported, and defended 
in Congress by me assisted by some others, and finally carried. They laid the foundation

Effect. I know not how wc shall so soon purj^c the Army of the Men 
you mention, as by prevaiUnj^ upon them to resent their own quarrels. 
To show you how exactly we concurrd in sentiment u\xm this Subject, 
I nuist tell you that when the Conj^ress were employing,' a little Leisure 
Time some days ago in considerinq- new Articles, and before I received 
your Letter. I proposed to strike out tliat Article which ])revents the send- 
ing" of Challenges, and pressed it as a Measure that would tend to make 
their Officers Gentlemen, or at least induce them to act as such, whilst in 
Company with Gentlemen; Stone seconded and supported the Motion, but 
we could not carry the Point. ^ I believe we must leave it to Time. We 
have done nothing with the Confederation for some Days, and it is of 
little Consequence if we never see it again ; for we have made such a Devil 
of it already that the Colonies can never agree to it. If my opinion was 
likely to be taken I would propose that the States should appoint a special 
Congress to be composed of new Members for this purpose â€” and that no 
Person should disclose any part of the present plan. If that was done we 
might then stand some Chance of a Confederation, at present we stand 
none at all.^ We have not as yet touched the Treaty " â€” and Independence 
has been declared upward of Six Weeks! We have heard of Deane's 
arrival in France but no letters from him. I am much pleased with the 
Spirit of your Convention, God grant they may receive the Blessings of 
Liberty, and by a wise Government fix those Blessings upon a strong and 
lasting Foundation. Exert my good Friend all your Abilities in the 
accomplishing of this delicate Business, so that you will be beloved by 
Posterity as truly as you are by your most affectionate 

Edward Rutledge. 

P. S. Remember me affectionately to Jay. We have sent to the South- 
ward for General Lee, lest any accident should befall Washington,^" 



of a discipline which, in time, brought our troops to a capacity of contending with British 
veterans, and a rivalry with the best troops of France." 

The letter to which Adams here refers was probably the letter of Joseph Reed, July 
25 (Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.. I. 576), referred, July 29, to the committee appointed 
to revise the Articles of War. The articles are printed in the Journals under Sept. 20. 
See also the Bibliographical Notes, ibid., VI. 1125-1126. The articles were somewhat 
revised Apr. 14, 1777. Cf. nos. 92, 142, post. 

'' Articles of War, section VII., articles 2 and 3 (Journals, V. 792). The discussion 
was probably on Aug. 13. 

8 See nos. 43, 83, 84, note 2, ante, and nos. 94, 138, 155, post. Rutledge's suggestion 
that " a special Congress to be composed of new members " ought to be chosen to draw 
up articles of confederation is one of the earliest expressions of what presently came to 
be the fundamental idea of a constitutional convention, the doctrine, namely, that a 
consitution should be framed by a body of delegates specially chosen for the purpose. 
Jefferson had, indeed, a few months earlier, enunciated the doctrine in a letter to Edmund 
Randolph, then in attendance at the Virginia convention (see Writings, ed. Ford, II. 7-9) ; 
and the Delaware convention, which met August 27 (only a few days after Rutledge's 
letter was penned) to frame a constitution for that state, appears to have been chosen 
with that principle definitely in view. See Van Tyne, American Revolution (American 
Nation series), pp. 139-140.

86. John Adams to Samuel Holden Parsons.^ 

Philadelphia, 19 August, 1776. 

Your favors of the 13th and 15th are before me. The gentlemen you 
recommend for Majors, Chapman and Dyer, will be recommended by the 
Board of War, and I hope agreed to in Congress 

With regard to encouragements in money and in land for soldiers to 
enlist during the war, I have ever been in favor of it, as the best economy 
and the best policy, and I have no doubt that rewards in land will be 
given, after the war is over. But the majority are not of my mind for 
promising it now. I am the less anxious about it, for a reason which 
does not seem to have much weight however with the majority. Although 
it may cost us more, and we may put now and then a battle to hazard by 
the method we are in, yet we shall be less in danger of corruption and 
violence from a standing army, and our militia will acquire courage, 
experience, discipline, and hardiness in actual service.^ 

I wish every man upon the continent was a soldier, and obliged, upon 
occasion, to fight, and determined to conquer or to die. Flight was 
unknown to the Romans. I wish it was to Americans. There was a 
flight from Quebec, and worse than a flight at the Cedars. If we do not 
atone for these disgraces, we are undone. 

A more exalted love of their country, a more enthusiastic ardor for 
military glory, and deeper detestation, disdain, and horror of martial 
disgrace must be excited among our people, or we shall perish in infancy. 
I will certainly give my voice for devoting to the infernal gods every 
man, high or low, who shall be convicted of bashfulness on the day of 
battle.' 

P. S. Since the above was written Congress has accepted the report 
of the Board of War, and appointed Dyer and Chapman, Majors. I had 
much pleasure in promoting Dyer, not only from his own excellent charac- 
ter, but from respect to my good friend his father.*

The Temper of the Colonies as professed in their several Petitions to 
the Crown was sincere. The Terms they proposed should then have been 
closed with, and all might have been Peace. I dare say your L^' as well as 
my self, laments they were not accepted. I remember I told you, that 
better wd never be offered, and I have not forgotten your just Comparison 
of the Sybyl's Leaves. 

But the Contempt with which those Petitions were treated, none of 
them being vouchsaf'd an Answer; and the cruel Measures since taken, 
have chang'd that Temper. It could not be otherwise To propose now 
to the Colonies a Submission to the Crown of Great Britain, would be 
fruitless. The Time is past. One might as well propose it to France, on 
the Footing of a former title. â–  ....

German Troops ; ^ and understanding from Col. Ross,^ that they are 
canton'd on the Island opposite to the Jersey Shore, I send you herewith 
some of the Resolutions of the Congress translated into their Language,

the Back, it being suppos'd by the Committee, that if a little Tobacco 
were put up in each as the Tobacconists use to do, and a Quantity made 
to fall into the Hands of that Soldiery, by being put into a Drift Canoe Â»

from Kent and New Castle of the elections, I wrote to Mr. McKean at Amboy, and

Sir. 

The late Conduct of Lord Drummond is as extraordinary, as his 
motives are dark and mysterious. To judge the most favourably of his 
Intentions, it should seem that an overweening Vanity has betrayed him 
into a criminal Breach of Honour. But whether his Views were upright, 
or intended only to mislead and deceive, cannot at present be a Matter of 
any importance. In the mean Time, I have the Pleasure to acquaint you. 
that Congress highly approve of the Manner in which you have checked 
the ofticious and intemperate Zeal of his Lordship. Whether his Designs 
were hostile, or friendly, he equally merited the Reproof you have given 
him; and I hope for the future he will be convinced, that it is highly 
imprudent to attract the Attention of the publick to a Character, which 
will only pass without Censure, when it passes without Notice. 

The Congress having considered the Matter thoroughly, are of Opinion 
to decline taking any public or farther Notice of his Lordship, or his 
Letters; and particularly as you have so fully expressed their Sentiments 
on the subject in your Letter to him. It was the Consideration of this 
Point that induced Congress to detain the Express till now.^

therefore, I have been constantly labouring to obtain an handsome En-

as yet prevailed, and indeed, I despair of ever Succeeding, unless the

Commission, the Congress have been induced, both from a Regard to 
your Merit while in the Army, and your Zeal and Attention since you left 
it, to request you will, if consistent with your Health, take the Command 
of the Forces in that Quarter. As soon as Congress can fix on some 
Officer to relieve you, they will do it, and only desire you, in the mean 
Time to continue in Command until such Appointment. Your readiness 
to comply with the Wishes of your Country, gives me the strongest 
Reason to believe, you will not resist their Application at this Juncture."

94. JosiAii Bartlett to William Whipple.* 

Philadelphia, August 27, 1776. 
Dear Sir: 

Last week tlie Articles of Confederation were fniislied by the Com- 
mittee of the Wliole House. They are a,l,^'lin printed as now amended by 
the Committee, and are deHvered to the members in the same manner as 
before, and are to undergo one operation through Congress more before 
they are sent to the several States for confirmation. What alterations 
will be made in them I know not ; but am afraid none for the better. This 
will occasion such a delay that there is no probability it will be sent in 
time to be laid before our Assembly before your return here : so I would 
not have you wait for it, but return as soon as convenient.^ The new 
Articles of War have passed Congress.' The plan of a treaty of foreign 
alliance has passed in the Committee of the Whole.* 

By the leave of Lord Howe, the famous Lord Drummond has, by a 
f^ag to General Washington, proposed sundry articles as the basis of a 
negotiation or conference, (they are nearly the same as those proposed 
by Lord North, called Lord North's Conciliatory Propositions;) and he 
requested leave of General Washington for himself and one or two more 
to repair to this city to propose those terms, which he had the impudence 
to say would have been accepted by the Colonies a few months ago. The 
General did not think proper to give him leave to come here, but in his 
answer told him he should send the papers to the Congress and wait their 
answer. He severely reprimanded Lord Drummond for his ofificiousness 
in meddling w-ith the business, but especially for his going to the Army 
under General Howe, contrary to his parole of honour which he gave 
when he was permitted to leave the Continent. I need not tell you the 
Congress have not accepted the proposed conference with his Lordship." 

Lord Howe has wrote an answer to Dr. Franklin's letter to him which 
you saw. It is full of professions of friendship for America, and of 
esteem and regard for the Doctor â€” very polite, but very artful. Â° ....

Philadelphia, August 28, 1776. 
Dear Sir, 

The Congress being advised, that there was a probability that the 
Hessians might be induced to quit the British service by offers of land, 
came to two resolves for this purpose, which, being translated into 
German and printed, are sent to Staten Island to be distributed, if practi- 
cable, among those people. Some of them have tobacco marks on the 
back, that so tobacco being put up in them in small quantities, as the 
tobacconists use, and suffered to fall into the hands of these people, they 
might divide the papers as plunder, before their officers could come to 
the knowledge of the contents, and prevent their being read by the men. 
That was the first resolve. A second has since been made for the officers 
themselves. I am desired to send some of both sorts to you, that, if you 
find it practicable, you may convey them among the Germans that shall 
come against you.^ ....

Aug. 22, it is learned that the battalion was the third, and imder the command of Col. 
George Weedon.

Philadelphia, September 3, 1776. 
Dear Sir: 

By that time this reaches you I expect you will be near ready to set out 
on your return to this city. Make all convenient haste. The Congress 
is, at this time, very thin. Colonel Lee is arrived here,* but several others 
have taken leave of absence, among them Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Hay- 
wood.' The unhappy affair of the 27th, on Long Island, has occasioned 
the evacuation of our works there and on Governour's Island. Our 
people were ensnared, and, what vexes me, in a very careless manner. 

Yesterday General Sullivan arrived at my lodgings, being on his parole. 
He says he has a verbal message to Congress, to propose himself and Lord 
Sterling in exchange for Generals Prescott and McDonald. He also says 
that Lord Howe expressed himself very desirous of an accommodation 
with America, without any more bloodshed â€” that he was very willing to 
meet, at almost any place, a number of the members of Congress, (as 
private gentlemen, for he could not own any such body as Congress,) 
to try if they could make any proposals for an accommodation; that he 
said he had waited near two months longer in England than he should 
have otherwise done, to procure proper powers for a final accommodation, 
with which he said he was now vested, etc., and he allow'ed General 
Sullivan to come here to propose the aforesaid conference to Congress. 
What will be done in the affair by Congress I know not, but think there 
are difficulties on both sides. If the Congress should accept of the pro- 
posed conference, only on a verbal message, when at the same time Lord 
Howe declares he can consider them only as private gentlemen, especially 
when we are certain he can have no powder to grant any terms we can 
possibly accept, this, I fear, will lessen the Congress in the eye of the 
publick, and perhaps at this time intimidate people when they see us catch- 
ing hold of so slender a thread to bring about a settlement. On the other 
hand, General Sullivan's arrival from Lord Howe with proposals of an 
accommodation, with thirty falsehoods in addition, are now spread over

this city, and will soon be over the Continent; and if we should refuse 
the conference, I fear the Tories, and moderate men, so called, will try 
to represent the Congress as obstinate, and so desirous of war and blood- 
shed that we would not so much as hear the proposals Lord Howe had 
to make, which they will represent (as they already do) to be highly 
advantageous for America, â€” even that he would consent that we should 
be independent provided we would grant some advantages as to trade. 
Such an idea, spread among the people, especially the soldiers, at this 
time, might be of the most fatal consequence. Whatever is done by Con- 
gress in the affair will, I hope, be ordered for the benefit of America.*

Maryland Convention.^ 

Philadelphia Sepr. 3d. 1776. 

Gentlemen, 

Our enemies being determined to make a powerful Attack on New 
York, and the States adjoining thereto; and having for this Purpose, 
collected their whole Force from every Part of the Continent, it is incum- 
bent on the United States of America to take the most effectual Measures 
to defeat their deep laid Schemes agt their Country. 

The Congress have just receiv'd Information from General Washing- 
ton of the very great and Superior Strength of the Enemy; and if we 
consider the recent Change in the Situation of our Affairs at New York, 
we shall soon be convinced that nothing will prove an Adequate Remedy 
in our present Circumstances but the most vigorous Exertions on our 
Part. I am therefore by Order of Congress to request you will immedi- 
ately send all the Aid in your power to our Army at New York. 

The State of our Affairs is so extremely critical, that Delay may be 
attended with fatal Consequences. Suffer me therefore to press you in 
the Name and by the Authority of your Country, to an immediate Com- 
pliance, and with all the Earnestness so naturally suggested by the Im- 
portance of the Cause. Altho' I doubt not your own Ardor would be a 
sufficient Stimulus when called on by the voice of Liberty, yet my anxiety 
is so great I cannot refrain on the present Occasion from beseeching you 
to exert yourselves. Every Thing is at Stake ; our Religion, Our Liberty, 
the Peace and Happiness of Posterity, are the grand Objects in Dispute;

and required him to put it in writing. Concerning the written statement John Adams 
remarks in his Autobiography (Works, III. 73"): "In this written statement of the 
message it ought to be observed, that General Sullivan has not inserted, what he had 
reported verbally, that Lord Howe had told him 'he would set the act of Parliament 
wholly aside, and that Parliament had no right to tax America, or meddle with her 
internal polity'." , ,, , ^

Sir, 

.... I mentioned in my last the arrival of General Sullivan, and 
then hinted the business of his coming. The day I wrote you last he 
was admitted in Congress, and informed them that he had been on board 
of the Eagle, and there had private conversation with Lord Howe; the 
substance of which was that his Lordship declared that he had ample 
powers, together with the General, to settle matters between Great Britain 
and Colonies, in such a manner as should be for the true interest and 
benefit of both, and to make such settlement permanent; that he wished 
for nothing more than to converse with General Washington, or some 
one or more members of Congress, on that head, but that there was a 
difficulty in the way which prevents it, for that his rank and situation was 
attended w-ith that kind of delicacy that he could not treat with the Con- 
gress as such, and had no doubt that the Congress from their situation 
lay under the same difficulty â€” therefore [he] proposed his having conver- 
sation, of an hour or two, with some of the members, as private gentle- 
men; that he w^ould meet them in that character, also wherever they 
pleased ; that he did not doubt by this step matters might be put in a train 
of accomodation, if not, that it would only be so much time lost ; that his 
Lordship further said that he had staid in England two months after he 
was otherwise ready to come on purpose to obtain those ample powers 
before mentioned, by which means the declaration of Independence had 
taken place before his arrival. 

There was other conversation, such as that his Lordship thought this 
a fine country, that he had many friends and acquaintances here, and that 
he should be pleased much to have an opportunity to ride through the 
country to see them etc. You, Sir, may be desirous to know what Con- 
gress think of this message, delivered by Sullivan at the request of Lord 
Howe. To satisfy your desire I think I may venture to say that a very 
great majority of the members look on it as an insult, and [I] believe a 
Resolution will pass that no proposals for the future be received unless 
reduced to writing, and signed [by] some person who has authority to

There has been a Change in our Affairs at New York. What Effects 
it will produce I cant pretend to foretell. I confess, I do not clearly foresee. 
Lord Howe is surrounded with disaffected American Machiavellians, 
Exiles from Boston and elsewhere, who are instigating him to mingle 
Art with Force. He has sent Sullivan here, upon his Parol, with the most 
insidious, 'tho ridiculous Message which you can conceive. It has put Us

2 In his Autobiography (IVorks. III. 80), Adams makes this comment on Sulli- 
van's mission : " The conduct of General Sullivan, in consenting to come to Philadelphia, 
upon so confused an errand from Lord Howe, though his situation, as a prisoner, was 
a temptation, and may be considered as some apology for it, appeared to me to betray such 
want of penetration and fortitude, and there was so little precision in the information 
he communicated, that I felt much resentment, and more contempt, upon the occasion, 
than was perhaps just. The time was extremely critical. The attention of Congress, the 
army, the States, and the people, ought to have been wholly directed to the defence of the 
country. To have it diverted and relaxed, by such a poor artifice and confused tale, 
appeared very reprehensible. To a few of my most confidential friends, I expressed my 
feelings, in a very few w^ords, which I found time to write, and all the letters of which 
I find copies in my letter book, are here subjoined, relative to this transaction, from its 
beginning to its end." See, for instance, his letter to William Tudor, Aug. 29. IVorks, IX. 
436 (the paragraph dated Sept. 2) ; also no. 117, post. 

Benjamin Rush, in his Memorial (p. 103), remarks concerning Adams's attitude toward 
the Sullivan mission : " I sat next to him while Gen'l Sullivan w-as delivering a request 
to Congress from Lord Howe for an interview with a committee of the house in their

agrees with the Report. I should be glad to write Mrs. Temple an 
Account of this, but have not Time. You will be so good as to let her

io8. John Witherspoon, Speech on the Message from 

Lord Howe.^ 

[September 5 (?), 1776.] 
Mr. President: 

The subject we are now upon is felt and confessed by us all to be of the 
utmost consequence, and perhaps I may also say, of delicacy and difii- 
culty. I have not been accustomed in such cases to make solemn profes- 
sions of impartiality, and shall not do it now, because I will not suppose 
that there are any suspicions to the contrary in the minds of those who 
hear me. Besides, the variety of opinions that have been formed and 
delivered upon it, seem to prove that we are giving our own proper 
judgment without prejudice or influence, which I hope will lead to the 
discovery of what is most wise and expedient upon the whole. 

As the deliberation arises from a message sent to us by Lord Howe, at 
least by his permission, I think it is of importance to attend with greater 
exactness to all the circumstances of that message than has been done by 
any gentleman who has yet spoken on the subject. It comes from the 
Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the King of Great Britain, and one 
who is said to carry a commission to give peace to America. 

From the conduct of the Ministry at home, from the acts of Parliament, 
and from Lord Howe's proclamation in conformity to both, it is plain that 
absolute, unconditional submission is what they require us to agree to, or 
mean to force us to. And from the most authentick private intelligence, 
the King has not laid aside his personal rancour; it is rather increasing 
every day. In these circumstances Lord Howe has evidently a great 
desire to engage us in a treaty ; and yet he has constantly avoided giving 
up the least punctilio on his side. He could never be induced to give 
General Washington his title. He plainly tells us he cannot treat with 
Congress as such ; but he has allowed a prisoner of war to come and tell 
us he would be glad to see us as private gentlemen. 

private capacities, after the defeat of the American Army on Long Island on the 26 
of August 1776. Mr. Adams under a sudden impression and dread of the consequences 
of the measure, whispered to me a wish ' that the first ball that had been fired on the day 
of the defeat of our Army had gone through his head '. When he rose to speak against 
the proposed interview, he called Gen'l Sullivan a ' decoy duck whom Lord Howe has 
sent among us to seduce us into a renunciation of our independence',"

September, iy/6 71 

It has been said that this is no insult or disgrace to the Congress ; that 
the point of honour is hard to be got over in making the first advances. 
This, sir, is mistaking the matter wholly. He has got over this point of 
honour; he has made the first overtures ; he has told General Washington, 
by Colonel Putnam, that he wished that message to be considered as 
making the first step. His renewed attempts by Lord Drummond, and 
now by General SulHvan, point out to all the world that he has made the 
first step. It w'\\\, doubtless, be related at home; and I am of opinion it 
is already written and boasted of to the ^Ministry at home that he has 
taken such a part. Therefore any evil or condescension that can attend 
seeking peace first, has been submitted to by him. Yet has he uniformly 
avoided any circumstance that can imply that we are anything else but 
subjects of the King of Great Britain in rebellion. Such a message as 
this, if in any degree intended as respectful to us, ought to have been 
secret; yet has it been open as the day. In short, such a message was 
unnecessary; for if he meant only to communicate his mind to the Con- 
gress by private gentlemen, he might have done that many w^ays, and it 
needed not to have been known either to the publick or the Congress till 
these private gentlemen came here on purpose to reveal it. These, then, 
are the circumstances which attend this message as it is now before us: 
and the question is, shall we comply with it in any degree or not? Let 
us ask w^hat benefit shall be derived from it? There is none yet shown 
to be possible. It has been admitted by every person without exception 
who has spoke, that we are not to admit a thought of giving up the inde- 
pendence we have so lately declared ; and by the greatest part, if not the 
whole, that there is not the least reason to expect that any correspondence 
we can have with him will tend to peace. Yet I think in the beginning of 
the debate such reasonings were used as seemed to me only to conclude 
that we should grasp at it as a means of peace. We w^ere told that it was 
easy for us to boast or be valiant here, but that our armies w^ere running 
aw'ay before their enemies. I never loved boasting, neither here nor any- 
where else. I look upon it as almost a certain forerunner of disgrace. I 
found my hope of success in this cause, not in the valour of Americans or 
the cowardice of Britons, but upon the justice of the cause, and still more 
upon the nature of things. Britain has first injured and inflamed America 
to the highest degree, and now^ attempts, at the distance of three thousand 
miles, to carrv on war with this w^hole countrv, and force it to absolute 
submission. If we take the whole events of the war since it commenced, 
we shall rather wonder at the uniformity of our success than be surprised 
at some cross events. We have seen hvayery as well as cowardice in this 
country, and there are no consequences of either that are probable, that 
can be worth mentioning as ascertaining the event of the contest. 

Lord Howe speaks of a decisive blow not being yet struck, as if this 
cause depended upon one battle, which could not be avoided. Sir, this is 
a prodigious mistake. We may fight no battle at all for a long time, or 
we may lose some battles, as \vas the case with the British themselves in 
the Scotch rebellion of 1745. and the cause notwithstanding be the same. 
I wish it were considered, that neither loss nor disgrace worth mentioning 
10 



 

lias befallen us in the late cnjjac^etnent, nor conii)arable to what the British 
troops have often snfTered. At the battle of Preston, sir, they broke to 
pieces and ran away like sheep, before a few Ilip^hlanders. I myself saw 
them do the same thing- at Falkirk, with very little difference â€” a small 
part only of the army making a stand, and in a few hours the whole 
retreatiiiiif with precipitation before their enemies. Did that make any 
difference in the cause? Not in the least â€” so lonq- as the body of the 
nation were determined, on principle, at^ainst the rebels. Nor would it 
have made any other difference, but in time, thouj^h they had got posses- 
sion of London, which they might have easily done if they had understood 
their business ; for the Militia in England there gathered together, behaved 
fiftv times worse than that of America has done lately. They generally 
disbanded and run off as soon as the rebels came within ten or twenty 
miles of them. In short, sir, from anything that has happened, I see not 
the least reason for our attending to this delusive message. On the con- 
trary, I think it is the very worst time that could be chosen for us, as it 
will be looked upon as the effect of fear, and diffuse the same spirit in 
some degree through different ranks of men. 

The improbability of anything arising from this conference, leading to 
a just and honourable peace, might be shown by arguments too numerous 
to be even so much as named. But what I shall mention only is, that we 
are absolutely certain, from every circumstance, from all the proceedings 
at home, and Lord Howe's own explicit declaration in his letter to Dr. 
Franklin, that he never will acknowledge the independence of the Ameri- 
can States. 

I observed that one or two members said, in objection to the report of 
the Board of War, that it was like a begging of a question, and making 
a preliminary of the whole subject in debate. Alas, sir, this is a prodigious 
mistake. It was not only not the whole, but it was properly no subject of 
debate at all, till within these three months. We were contending for the 
restoration of certain privileges under the Government of Great Britain, 
and we were praying for re-union with her. But in the beginning of July, 
with the universal approbation of all the States now united, we renounced 
this connection, and declared ourselves free and independent. Shall we 
bring this into question again ? Is it not a preliminary ? has it not been 
declared a preliminary by many gentlemen, who liave yet given their 
opinion for a conference, while they have said they w^ere determined on 
no account and on no condition to give up our independence? It is then 
a necessary preliminary, and it is quite a different thing from any punc- 
tilios of ceremony. If France and England were at war, and they were 
both desirous of peace, there might be some little difficulty as to who 
should make the first proposals; but if one of them should claim the other 
as they did long ago as a vassal or dependent subject, and should signify 
a desire to converse with the other, or some deputed by him, and propose 
him many privileges, so as to make him even better than before, I desire 
to know how such a proposal would be received? If we had been for 
ages an independent Republic, we should feel this argument with all its 
force. That we do not feel it, shows that we have not yet acquired the 



September, lyyd 73 

whole ideas and habits of independence : from which I only infer, that 
every step taken in a correspondence as now proposed, will be a virtual 
or partial renunciation of that dig^nity so lately acquired. 

I beg you would observe, sir, that Lord Howe himself was fully sensible 
that the Declaration of Independence precluded any treaty, in the charac- 
ter in which he appeared ; as he is said to have lamented that he had not 
arrived ten days sooner, before that declaration was made. Hence it 
appears, that entering into any correspondence with him in the manner 
now proposed, is actually giving up, or at least subjecting to a new con- 
sideration, the independence which we have declared. If I may be allowed 
to say it without offence, it seems to me that some members have un- 
awares admitted this, though they are not sensible of it; for when they 
say that it is refusing to treat, unless the whole be granted us, they must 
mean that some part of that whole must be left to be discussed and 
obtained, or yielded, by the treaty. 

But, sir, many members of this House have either yielded, or at least 
supposed, that no desirable peace, or no real good, could be finally ex- 
pected from this correspondence, which is wished to be set on foot; but 
they have considered it as necessary in the eye of the publick, to satisfy 
them that we are always ready to hear anything that will restore peace to 
the country. In this view it is considered as a sort of trial of skill between 
Lord Howe and us, in the political art. As I do truly believe, that many 
members of this House are determined by this circumstance, I shall con- 
sider it with some attention. With this view it will be necessary to dis- 
tinguish the publick in America into three great classes: i. The Tories, 
our secret enemies. 2. The Whigs, the friends of independence, our 
sincere and hearty supporters. 3. The Army, who must fight for us. 

As to the first of them, I readily admit that they are earnest for our 
treating. They are exulting in the prospect of it; they are spreading 
innumerable lies to forward it. They are treating the Whigs already with 
insult and insolence upon it. It has brought them from their lurking 
holes; they have taken liberty to say things in consequence of it, which 
they durst not have said before. In one word, if we set this negotiation 
on foot, it will give new force and vigour to all their seditious machina- 
tions. But, sir, shall their devices have any influence upon us at all? If 
they have at all, it should be to make us suspect that side of the question 
which they embrace. In cases where the expediency of a measure is 
doubtful, if I had an opportunity of knowing what my enemies wished me 
to do, I would not be easily induced to follow their advice. 

As to the Whigs and friends of independence, I am well persuaded that 
multitudes of them are already clear in their minds, that the conference 
should be utterly rejected ; and to those who are in doubt about its nature, 
nothing more will be requisite than a clear and full information of the 
state of the case, which I hope will be granted them. 

As to the Army, I cannot help being of opinion, that nothing will more 
effectually deaden the operations of war, than what is proposed. We do 
not ourselves expect any benefit from it, but they will. And they will 
possibly impute our conduct to fear and jealously as to the issue of the 



 

cause; wliith will add to tlioir present little discourag^enient, and produce 
a timorous and dcspcMidcnt spirit.' 

109. John Adams to Mrs. Adams.* 

[Philadelphia], Friday, 6 September, 1776. 

This day. I think, has been the most remarkable of all. Sullivan came 
here from Lord Howe, five days ago, with a message, that his lordship 
desired a half an hour's conversation with some of the members of Con- 
gress in their private capacities. We have spent three or four days in 
debating, whether we should take any notice of it. I have, to the utmost 
of my abilities, during the whole time, opposed our taking any notice of 
it. But, at last, it was determined by a majority, " that the Congress being 
the representatives of the free and independent States of America, it was 
improper to appoint any of their members to confer in their private charac- 
ters with his lordship. But they would appoint a committee of their body, 

' Benjamin Rush gives the following account of this debate : 
" I took part in several debates. The first or second time I spoke was against a motion 
for a Committee of Congress, to meet Lord Howe in their private capacity, to confer 
iM>on a peace with Great Britain. On the same side of the question John Adams, Dr. 
W'itherspoon and George Ross spoke with uncommon eloquence. The last of those 
gentlemen began his speech by asking â€” what the conduct of George the 3rd would be had 
Congress proposed to negotiate with him as Elector of Hanover instead of King of Great 
Britain â€” he would spurn, and very properly spurn the insulting proposal. ' Let the 
American States ', said he, ' act in the same manner. We are bound to cherish the 
honor of our countrj' which is now committed to our care. Nothing could dishonor the 
sovereign of Britain, that would not in equal circumstances dishonor us.' In the con- 
clusion of my speech, I said. ' that our country was far from being in a condition to make 
it necessary for us to humble ourselves at the feet of Great Britain. We had lost a 
battle, and a small island but the city and State of New York were still in possession of 
their independence. But suppose that State had been conquered, suppose half the States 
in the Union had been conquered â€” nay, suppose all the States in the Union except one had 
been conquered, still let not that one renounce her independence ; but I will go further â€” â–  
should this solitary State, the last repository' of our freedom be invaded, let her not 
survive her precious birthright, but in yielding to superior force, let her last breath be 
spent in uttering the word Independetice.' The speakers in favor of the motion were 
Ed. Rutledge, Thos. Lynch, John [Thomas] Stone, and several others. One of them 
in answer to the concluding sentence of my speech, said, ' he would much rather live 
with dependence, than die with independence upon his lips.' The motion was carried 
with some modification. The committee appointed to confer with Lord Howe were Dr. 
Franklin, John Adams and Edward Rutledge. John Adams objected for a while to 
going upon this embassy, but was prevailed upon by the minority to consent to it. They 
met on Staten Island, but the conference ended in a discovery that Lord Howe had no 
power to grant us peace, upon any other condition than a rescinding the declaration of 
independence. 

" The issue of this negotiation demonstrated that the time in which the States declared 
themselves to be independent was the proper one. It prevented their dissolution after 
the defeat and the retreat of the American armies in the subsequent summer and autumn. 
It moreover produced a secession of Tories, and timid Whigs from the Councils of the 
United States, and left the government of the country in the hands of men of fixed 
and determined principles and tempers. Maryland had yielded a little to the gloomy 
complexion of public aflFairs. She had instructed her delegates in Congress to vote 
for an accommodation with Great Britain any measure (meaning independence) to the 
contrary, and one of the delegates said to me in the street soon afterwards, that General 
Howe's proclamation contained everything we could wish and that we ought now to 
submit to Great Britain." Memorial, p. 90. See no. 102, note 2, ante.

to wait on him, to know whether he had power to treat with Congress 
upon terms of peace, and to hear any propositions that his lordship may 
think proper to make." 

When the committee came to be balloted for, Dr. Franklin and your 
humble servant were unanimously chosen. Colonel R. H. Lee and Mr. 
Rutledge had an equal number; but, upon a second vote, Mr. Rutledge 
was chosen. I requested to be excused, but was desired to consider of it 
until to-morrow. My friends here advise me to go. All the stanch and 
intrepid are very earnest with me to go, and the timid and wavering, if 
any such there are, agree in the request. So I believe I shall undertake 
the journey. I doubt whether his lordship will see us, but the same com- 
mittee will be directed to inquire into the state of the army at New York, 
so that there will be business enough, if his lordship makes none. It would 
fill this letter-book to give you all the arguments, for and against this 
measure, if I had liberty to attempt it. His lordship seems to have been 
playing off a number of Machiavelian manoeuvres, in order to throw upon 
us the odium of continuing this war. Those who have been advocates 
for the appointment of this committee are for opposing manoeuvre to 
manoeuvre, and are confident that the consequence will be, that the odium 
will fall upon him. However this may be, my lesson is plain, to ask a 
few questions and take his answers.'^ 

I can think of but one reason for their putting me upon this embassy, 
and that is this. An idea has crept into many minds here, that his lord- 
ship is such another as Mr. Hutchinson, and they may possibly think that 
a man who has been accustomed to penetrate into the mazy windings of 
Hutchinson's heart, and the serpentine wiles of his head, may be tolerably 
qualified to converse with his lordship.

very discouraging to the States and animating to the Enemy, but the

which is a good Design if accomplished in a way that will not disagreeably

do not allow the States to be independent, will be without Hesitation 
rejected,'

Gentlemen 

.... Lord How^e hath manifested Repeatedly a desire to confer with 
some members of Congress w'hich has not been regarded, until he sent 
General Sullivan with a Message to Congress Intimating his dilicate Situ- 
ation, and desiring that he might confer with them tho' at the same time 
saying he could not do it in that Capacity but that he had large powers to 
enable him to settle the Controversy etc. The Congress rather suppose 
this a finness to Create a belief in the people that he is desirous for peace 
and we desire to protract the w^ar. however after mature consideration, 
Congress resolved as the Representatives of the United Independant 
States of America, to appoint a Committee to meet his Lordship if he 
pleases to know^ what Authority he has to Settle peace and hear his pro- 
posals that on the one hand if he has any Authority and proposals that 
are Serious they may know; and on the other if it be a finness the world 
make know- it this matter is not fully made public as yet but have tho't

Philadelphia, September 7th. 1776. 
Sir, 

.... In my last letter ^ to you I gave you the substance of Sullivan's 
message and what I then thought would be the determination of Congress 
thereon, however, the matter after three days debate, has in some measure 
received a different determination. The Congress have refused sending 
any of their members to confer, as private gentlemen, but with a view to 
satisfy some disturbed minds out of doors, rather than expectation of its 
bringing about peace, they have appointed a Committee of Congress to 
repair to New York, with powers to confer with Lord Howe, to know 
the extent of his powers, and the terms he shall propose. General Sullivan 
was furnished with a copy of this Resolution, certified, and returned to 
Lord Howe yesterday.^ You will see by this that if Lord Howe receives 
the Committee thus sent he acknowledges the Congress, and of course 
the independence of the States, which I am convinced he will not do. Yet 
it may tend to convince the people at large that we are desirous of peace, 
whenever it can be had upon those principles

sequence of his IMessage by Gen. Sullivan to know if He has power to 
treat of Peace, what his Power is, and to hear his Propositions, if he 
please to receive Them as such, if not the World will be satisfied there is 
no sincerity in his Professions. We are already, the Measure is an

Sir: 

.... Mr. Hopkins tells me, that he doth not propose to return to Con- 
gress until spring if ever, it is therefore necessary that an Additional 
Delegate Should be immediately appointed; for otherwise the State of 
Rhode-Island, etc. may be unrepresented, which might be attended with 
pernicious Consequences to Us. I may fall sick and not be able to attend 
Congress when some ^vlatter may be brought upon the Carpet which will 
immediately relate to our State ; not to mention that if two delegates were 
here they might have an Opportunity to relax now and then from that 
constant Attention which if One Delegate only should be continued here, 
he would be obliged to give, unless he should leave the State unrepresented 
in Congress, which I am determined not to do let what will be the Conse- 
quence: and a constant Attendance on Congress for nine Months without 
any Relaxation is too much even for a robust Constitution. Beside it is 
necessary that Motions should be made and supported, in which Case the 
Advantage of having Two on the Same Side is manifest. In Causes of 
no great Importance it is common to engage Tw'O Lawyers, and the vulgar 
Observation that Two Heads are better than One is just. Can then the 
State of Rhode-Island hesitate about immediately appointing an Addi-

tional Delegate ? I am sure it cannot. I should be exceedingly glad that 
Gov Hopkins might return ; for he is well acquainted with the Mode of 
conducting Business, and is well esteemed in Congress, and I have Reason 
to think from what hath passed, that we should act in Concert and 
Harmony; but if he should conclude not to return it would be best that 
Two Should be immediately appointed ; for Matters of great Consequence 
will be on the Carpet, in the Multitude of Council is Safety ; and in that 
Case the Delegates might alternately visit Home, brace up their relaxed 
Minds and Bodies by a journey and enjoying their native Air, and thereby 
be better able to discharge the Duties of their Office. 

There is nothing against our States appointing Three Delegates but the 
Expenses, and if the Amount of the Allowance to the two Delegates, and 
their Expenses for one year be summed up and compared with what would 
be the Amount of the Expense to the State of those delegates, at five 
dollars per Day, I believe the Difference will be found to be but trifling ; 
but if it should be something considerable I am sure the Benefits resulting 
to the State therefrom would compensate for any such additional expense. 
If a confederacy should hereafter take Place, a Council of State * would 
doubtless be appointed, in which Case our State would have only One 
Delegate to support constantly, the other Two, if three should be ap- 
pointed, would be present only a small Part of a year, when the Congress 

should sit Congress have ordered One of our battaP to N. York, 

and its Place to be supplied w'ith a Battalion of Militia from Massa- 
chusetts. It was moved at first that both the Battalions should be ordered 
thither. I opposed the Motion to the best of my Abilities, and think We 
have come off pretty well.^ I expect that if our Affairs at New York 
should take an ill Turn, that the other Battalion w'ill be ordered from our 
State; for it is the Sentiment of Congress that the Continental battaP 
should be drawn together for that greater Reliance is to be placed in them 
than a Militia unaccustomed to Discipline and the Hardships of a Camp : 
And indeed the liberties of this Country in my Opinion cannot be estab- 
lished but by a large standing Army. Heartily wishing Success to our 
Cause, and to you. Sir, and your Family, Health and Prosperity, I con- 
tinue to be, with great Respect

Sir 

The Congress having appointed Mr Adams, Mr Rutledge and my self 
to meet Lord Howe, and hear what Propositions he may have to make, 
we purpose setting out to-morrow, and to be at Perth Amboy on Wednes- 
day morning, as you will see by the enclos'd, which you are requested im- 
mediately to forward to his Lordship; and if an Answer comes to your 
hands, that you would send it to meet us at Amboy. What we have heard 
of the Badness of the Roads between that Place and New York, makes 
us wish to be spar'd that part of the Journey.'' 

117. John Adams to James Warren.* 

Philadelphia, 8 September, 1776. 

I am going to-morrow morning on an errand to Lord Howe, not to 
beg a pardon, I assure you, but to hear vv'hat he has to say. He sent 
Sullivan here to let us know that he wanted a conversation with some 
members of Congress. We are going to hear him. But as Congress have 
voted that they cannot send members to talk with him in their private 
capacities, but will send a committee of their body as representatives of 
the free and independent States of America, I presume his Lordship 
cannot see us, and I hope he will not; but if he should, the whole will 
terminate in nothing. Some think it will occasion a delay of military 
operations, wdiich they say Ave much want. I am not of this mind. Some 
think it will clearly throw the odium of continuing this war on his Lord- 
ship and his master. I w^ish it may. Others think it will silence the tories 
and establish the timid whigs. I wish this also, but do not expect it. 
But all these arguments, and twenty others as mighty, would not have 
convinced me of the necessity, propriety, or utility of this embassy, if 
Congress had not determined on it. I was totis virihus against it, from 
first to last. But upon this occasion New Hampshire, Connecticut, and 
even Virginia gave way. All sides agreed in sending me. The stanch 
and intrepid, I suppose, such as were enemies to the measure, as well as 
myself, pushed for me, that as little evil might come of it as possible. 
Others agreed to vote for me in order to entice some of our inflexibles to 
vote for the measure. You will hear more of this embassy. It will be 
famous enough.^ 

Your secretary ^ will rip about this measure, and well he may. Noth- 
ing. I assure you, but the unanimous vote of Congress, the pressing

My Dear friend: 

.... Genl. Sullivan brought a mesage from Lord Howe to Congress 
in consequence of which they have sent Doctor Franklin, John Adams 
and Ned Rutledge. I doubt in my own mind any good effect that it can 
have, as he was desirous to meet them in their private ' character. I will 
enclose you the resolve of Congress. Sullivan says that L. Howe said he 
was ever against taxing of us, and that they had no right to interfere with 
our internal Police, and that he was very sure America could not be con- 
quered, and that it was a great pitty so brave a nation should be cutting 
one another to pieces.^ ....

In Consequence of the Message which Genl. Sullivan delivered to Con-

Members, they have, after great Debate, been induced to pass the first 
Resolution of the 5th. of Sepr. and have since appointed three Gentlemen 
on that Business, as you will observe by a subsequent Resolution, to 
which, without any Comment, I beg Leave to refer you. But in Order 
to prevent similar Messages for the Future, they have passed a Resolve 
directing the Mode in which all applications shall hereafter be made, 
either to Congress, or the Commander in Chief of the Army, and to which 
only any Attention is to be paid. I beg Leave to refer you to the Resolve 
itself, as the future Rule of your Conduct with Respect to every such 
verbal application, until it shall be altered, or you shall hear further from 
Congress on the subject.Â® ....

The proposal of Lord Howe for the exchange of Generals Sullivan and 
Lord Stirling for Prescott and McDonald is accepted by the Congress. 
We have also agreed to send three of our members, not as private gentle- 
men, but as a committee of our body, to meet Lord Howe, to know of 
him whether he has any terms of peace to propose, and what they are, 
etc., etc. Whether Lord Howe wnll meet them as a committee of Con- 
gress, is uncertain. The gentlemen appointed are Doctor Franklin, Mr. 
Adams, and Mr. Rutledge. The two former had the unanimous vote of 
Congress, and at the first vote there was a tie between Colonel R. H. Lee 
and Mr. Rutledge ; but as Mr. Lee had opposed the measure, he declined

Stockton and Rutledge, and the latter carried it.^ 

Nothing has since been done about the Confederation, as the Congress 
is pretty thin, and hurried with other business 

There is a report from the Board of War now before Congress, for 
putting our army on a more respectable footing than at present.' The 
substance is, that eighty-four regiments should be inlisted to serve during 
the war, and to give, as an encouragement, one hundred acres of land and 
[20]* dollars bounty, to be proportioned to such State, who are to take 
care that it's quota is raised. The proportion set to our Colony is four 
regiments, which is too much, and shall try to get it altered if I am able 
to attend Congress when it comes on. This plan, perhaps, may be some- 
what altered, but will, I am pretty sure, be adopted in the main. Qtiere : 
whether, as this is like to be the case, it is best for our State to do any 
thing at present about raising the regiment ordered in the Spring for our 
own defence ; and whether petitioning Congress to take into their pay our 
Colonial troops will not be best, considering all circumstances?

II September, 1776. 
My dear Sir, 

Your favor of this morning is just put into my hands.^ In answer I 
must beg leave to inform you, that our conference with Lord Howe has 
been attended with no immediate advantages. He declared that he had 
no powers to consider us as independent States ; and we easily discovered 
that, were we still dependent, we should have nothing to expect from 
those with which he is vested. He talked altogether in generals; â€” that 
he came out here to consult, advise, and confer with gentlemen of the 
greatest influence in the Colonies, about their complaints ; that the King 
would revise the Act of Parliament, and royal instructions, upon such 
reports as should be made; and appeared to fix our redress upon his 
Majesty's good will and pleasure. This kind of conversation lasted for 
several hours, and, as I have already said, without any effect. 

Our reliance continues, therefore, to be under God, on your wisdom 
and fortitude, and that of your forces ; that you may be as successful as 
I know you are worthy, is my most sincere wish.^ ....

* Walter Livingston. Cf. nos. 56, 123, ante. In Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.,_ II. 
^2)2i7, is a document, dated Nov. 13, containing a complaint of Jarnes Deane against 
Walter Livingston, and what appears to be a report of the committee appointed on 
Trumbull's letter of Sept. 7 (see note 2, above) relative to the controversy. This report 
is printed as a foot-note in the Journals (ed. Ford), V. 750 (Sept. n). 

5 This letter of Walter Livingston has not been found. There is, however, a 
letter from Walter Livingston to Robert R. Livingston, Aug. 25. 1776 (original in 
possession of Mr. Johnston L. Redmond of New York; photostat in possession of the 
Carnegie Institution), which states that General Schuyler had advised Congress that the 
army be supplied by contract, and would write to-morrow, recommending that the 
" refusal " of the contract be given to Walter Livingston. " I must earnestly entreat 
you", says Walter Livingston, "to write every friend you have in Congress requesting 
them to exert themselves, (if a Contract is made) to obtain the refusal of it for me." In 
a postscript he adds: "I have just wrote to-our members in Congress." The latter is 
probably the letter to which Williams refers. In regard to supplying the army by con- 
tract, see nos. 145, 162, 164, 165, 172, 175, post.

the sum and substance of their Report is, that havinj^;- sent a previous 
Messag-e to him he aj^-recil to receive 'I'hem on Staten Island at a house 
opposite Ambuy. he accordinjj^ly sent over a Bar^e W'echiisd. morning. 
They went in without Ceremony. H. met Them on their Landing, 
comphmented Them on the Honor They did, by their unhmeted Con- 
fidence tliey placed in Him, by puting Them selves so intirely in his Power 
etc. waited on Them to the House, entertained them most politely, and 
with a cold Collation, etc. introduced the Subject by informing Them 
how He first came to give his Attention to this American Dispute, viz the 
passing the Boston Port Bill awakend and alarmed his youthful remem- 
brance and attention to that Town and Province which had been im- 
pressed on Him from the high Respect and Honor They had done his 
Brother etc. and from that Time he attended to the American 
Affairs etc. 

He was urged to come over, had an ardent Desire to settle the Contro- 
versie amicably etc. 

being asked if He had Power to settle it, He ownd He had no other 
than to confer with Congress Members, but not as such, or any other 
Gent, whom They called Rebels, (this it seems took him his two months 
to obtain) and to move and urge Them to their Duty etc. and to deliver 
[ ?] Them in the Kings Peace. He had no power to treat with Them as 
Members of Congress, and no Terms or Proposals to make to any, with- 
out a full return to their Allegiance as an indispensible Preliminary, 
when that sho*^ be come into his Majesty wo^ certainly cause the grievious 
Acts of Parliament to be revised, and if it sho"^ appear just and fit, his 
Majesty wo"^ obtain such reasonable Relaxation as He sho*^ think just 
and right, or to that purpose, this is the Substance as I can recollect. 
So that on the whole He appears to have no Kind of Power but what is 
contained in the Act of Parliamt. saveing a Liberty of personal Confer- 
ance with the Rebels, as well as the Friends of Governmt. 

This is what was expected by almost every one who were for sending 
Them, indeed there is less daubing and Pretentions of Powers, and much 
less plausible pretentions and assurances of relaxation and generous fair 
Treatment etc. than was expected. He says Genl Sullivan mis took him, 
in saying he offerd that Parlit. wo'^ give up the Idea of Taxation and 
govern^ our internal Police etc.^ 

thus, it is conceived one great point is gained, is to strike the Torys 
dumb, or rather to defeat and kill the impressions they were makeing and 
wo'^ have made on many Friendly but credulous Minds by their confident 
and undaunted Assertions, that Ld H. was vested with full and ample 
Powers to settle the Controversie on the most equitable Terms and such 
as wo^ give perfect Satisfaction to all America except the turbulent and 
haughty, who wished to continue the War, for their own Honor and 
Emolument, and was disposed and evidently desirous to do so. 

His Ld. Ship expresd his great Pain and Regret for the unhappy Con- 
sequences to America of their refusal to submit etc. and was told America

wo^ use great Endeavors to save those Consequences safe and save him 
that Pain. 

the whole affair will I trust be published, in a few days. The Com*'= 
desired till Monday to draw up and lay in their Report in Writing.* I 
have wrote our Govr. all but this Result. I wish you co*^ immediately 
send him this or a Copy of it, as I cannot write him now, and fear my 
Letters may miscarry. 

126. Caesar Rodney to George Read.^ 

Philadelphia, September 13th. 1776, 
Dear Sir, 

.... The people here have been, for several days, fully employed in 
forming conjectures with respect to the conference between the Com- 
missioners of Congress and Lord Howe. They have been various â€” some 
Lord Howe has full powers, and if we have not peace it is the fault of 
Congress â€” others there is no doubt but they will finally settle matters, 
and the armies be disbanded â€” others again, are cursed if they believe he 
has any powers at all. However, this business is put an end to by the 
return of the Committee, who report â€” that having sent a letter to Lord 
Howe, by Express, to acquaint him of their coming, they proceeded to 
Amboy, where they arrived on Tuesday evening, and there, the same 
evening, received a letter from Lord Howe, in answer to theirs, letting 
them know that he would meet them, on Wednesday, at a house on Staten 
Island, opposite Amboy â€” that his Lordship the next day sent his boat for 
them, with a flag, and met them himself at the water-side, and in a very 
polite manner conducted them up to the house, where he had a dinner, 
and plenty of good wine for them, and that after dinner they had a con- 
ference, which, with the time they were dining, was about three hours. 
Upon the whole it seems his Lordship has no power to make a peace, or 
even to order a cessation of arms â€” that he had a power to confer with 
any person or persons whatsoever to hear what they had to offer, and 
report to his majesty, but that previous to any thing else we must return 
to and acknowledge obedience to his majesty. This being done, he did 
not doubt, on his representing matters home, but that the several acts of 
parliament and instructions might and would be revised, and many of our 
grievances removed.^ ....

to recommend as Surgeon to it. I shall recommend a Paymaster and 
Surgeon for the Battalion that shall remain at Newport, when it shall be 
known which of the Battalions hath marched to N. York. At present it 
is to me uncertain; for the President first required the Commanding 
Officer to order One of the Battalions to N. York ; and afterwards, when 
it was known that the Field Officers were not commissionated. they were 
ordered by Congress to be commissionated, agreeable to the Recom- 
mendation of the Assembly, and the Second, Col. Lippitt's Battalion is 
ordered to march to N. York provided the first should not have marched 
before the Arrival of the last Direction of Congress.* ....

Dear Sir: 

.... Last Wednesday our Committee met Lord Howe on Staten- 
Island, where they ate and drank together. He treated them with great 
civility and politeness; and after about three hours' conversation, they 
took their leave of each other. His Lordship's conversation was full of 
his friendship for America â€” particularly the town of Boston, for their 
respect to the memory of his brother. He said that the ravaging and 
destroying America would give him great pain and uneasiness. Dr. 
Franklin replied that we should take proper, and he hoped effectual, care 
to prevent his Lordship's feelings on that account. On the whole all the 
terms he had to propose were, that we first of all lay down our arms and 
return to our allegiance; and then, he said, the King and Parliament 
would consider the acts we formerly complained of, and if they judged 
it proper would alter or amend them. They told him that General Sulli- 
van said, that his Lordship in conversation told him that the King and 
Parliament would give up the right of taxation and of intermeddling with 
the internal police of the Colonies, and desired to know what authority

he had to say it. Lord Howe repHed, that General Sullivan must certainly 
have misunderstood him, as he had no right to say any such thing, nor 
did he believe the Parliament would give up those claims. The Com- 
mittee are about to publish the whole affair, which I hope will stop the 
mouths of the weak and credulous, who have had great hopes of peace 
from the supposed great powers entrusted with Lord Howe as a Com- 
missioner for that purpose.^ .... 

The affair of the Confederation rests at present. The Committee of 
the Whole have agreed that ninety regiments shall be inlisted for five 
years, if not sooner discharged by Congress. The affair of bounty is not 
yet settled ; the proposal of giving lands as a part of the bounty has 
boggled us ; however, it will be got over in a few days, I believe, and sent 
forward. The great difficulty of raising men for so long a period, made 
me think it my duty to prevent more being required of our State than 
their just proportion by numbers; and by producing the return of our 
number of inhabitants, I have got the proportion to be fixed at three 
instead of four regiments for our State, to be raised and completed for 
that term.^

Yesterday morning, I returned with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Rutledge

conversation with him. The result of this interview will do no disservice to 
us. It is now plain that his lordship has no power, but what is given him 
in the act of Parliament. His commission authorizes him to grant par- 
dons upon submission, and to converse, confer, consult and advise with 
such persons as he may think proper, upon American grievances, upon the 
instructions to Governors and the acts of Parliament, and if any errors 
should be found to have crept in, his majesty and the ministry w^ere willing 
they should be rectified.^ ....

terms; but said, he had waited two months in England to prevail with 
the Ministry to empower him to converse and confer with Gentn. of influ- 
ence in America, that he was sure of the good intentions of the King and 
the Ministry; and if we would return to our allegiance, they wou'd revise

131. John Penn to the North Carolina Council of Safety.^ 

Phila. Septr. 16. 1776. 
Dear Sir 

I wrote to you by Thomas Hayward Esqr. one of the Delegates of So. 
Carolina that General Howe was in possession of Long Island as also the 
manner in which we left it." General Sullivan who was made a prisoner 
on that occasion was sent here lately by Lord Howe with a message that 
his Lordship was very desirous to converse wnth. some of the members of 
Congress as private Gentn. and that he would meet them as Mr. Howe 
that he had great powers from the King to negotiate a peace, tho we were 
pursuaded that he only intended to throw the odium of carrying on the 
war on the Congress having no reason to believe that he had any such 
authority. Yet to counteract his design Doctr. Franklin, John Adams 
and Edwd Rutledge esqrs were directed to meet his Lordship not as pri- 
vate Gentn. but as a Committee of Congress to know of him what his 
powers were if any he had to treat with the Congress on the subject of 
peace. 

The Gentn. had a conference with Lord How^e who owned that he had 
no terms to offer to America and was not at liberty to treat with any set 
of men who were Representatives of the People, that he had a right to 
converse \vith Individuals and represent to the King the substance of 
what passed. I hope this will have a good effect as it will satisfie the 
people at large that we have no alternitive for our safety but our spirit 
as Soldiers.'

132. John Adams to Samuel Adams.* 

Philadelphia, 17 September, 1776. 

In a few lines of the 8th instant I promised you a more particular 
account of the conference. On Monday, the committee set off from Phila- 
delphia, and reached Brunswick on Tuesday night. Wednesday morning, 
they proceeded to Amboy, and from thence to Staten Island, where they 
met the Lord Howe, by whom they were politely received and entertained. 
His lordship opened the conference by giving us an account of the motive 
which first induced him to attend to the dispute with America, which he 
said was the honor which had been done to his family by the Massachu- 
setts Bay, which he prized very highly. From whence I concluded, in 
my own mind, that his lordship had not attended to the controversy earlier 
than the Port Bill and the Charter Bill, and consequently must have a 
very inadequate idea of the nature as well as of the rise and progress of 
the contest. 

His lordship then observed, that he had requested this interview, that 
he might satisfy himself whether there was any probability that America 
would return to her allegiance ; but he must observe to us, that he could 
not acknowledge us as members of Congress, or a committee of that body, 
but that he only desired this conversation with us as private gentlemen, 
in hopes that it might prepare the way for the people's returning to their 
allegiance and to an accommodation of the disputes between the two 
countries; that he had no power to treat with us as independent States, 
or in any other character than as British subjects and private gentlemen ; 
but that upon our acknowledging ourselves to be British subjects, he had 
power to consult with us ; that the act of parliament had given power to 
the king, upon certain conditions, of declaring the colonies to be at peace ; 
and his commission gave him power to confer, advise, and consult with 
any number or description of persons concerning the complaints of the 
people in America ; that the king and ministry had very good dispositions 
to redress the grievances of the people, and reform the errors of admin- 
istration in America ; that his commission gave him powder to converse 
with any persons whatever in America concerning the former instructions 
to governors, and the acts of parliament complained of ; that the king and 
ministry were very w^illing to have all these revised and reconsidered, and 
if any errors had crept in, if they could be pointed out, were very willing 
that they should be rectified. 

Mr. Rutledge mentioned to his Lordship what General Sullivan had 
said, that his Lordship told him he would set the acts of parliament wholly 
aside, and that parliament had no right to tax America, or meddle with 

* See the Journals, Sept. 16 ; cf. no. 135, post.

her internal polity. His I.orclsliip answered Mr. Rutledge that General 
Sullivan had misunderstood him. and extended his words much heyond 
their import. 

His Ix)rdship g^ave us a long- account of his negotiations in order to 
obtain powers sufViciently ample for his purpose. He said he told them 
(the ministry, I suppose he meant) that those persons whom you call 
rel)els, arc the most proper to confer with of any, because they are the 
persons who complain of grievances. The others, those who are not in 
arms, and are not. according to your ideas, in rebellion, have no com- 
plaints or grievances; they are satisfied, and therefore it would be to no 
purpose to converse with them. To that his Lordship said, he would not 
accept the command or commission until he had full power to confer with 
any persons whom he should think proper, who had the most abilities and 
influence. But. having obtained these powers, he intended to have gone 
directly to Philadelphia, not to have treated with Congress as such, or 
to have acknowledged that body, but to have consulted with gentlemen 
of that body in their private capacities upon the subjects in his commission. 

His Lordship did not incline to give us any further account of his 
powers, or to make any other propositions to us, in one capacity or 
another, than those which are contained in substance in the foregoing 
lines. 

I have the pleasure to assure you, that there was no disagreement in 
opinion among the members of the committee upon any one point. They 
were perfectly united in sentiment and in language, as they are in the 
result of the whole, which is, that his Lordship's powers are fully ex- 
pressed in the late act of parliament, and that his commission contains no 
other authority than that of granting pardons, with such exceptions as 
the commissioners shall think proper to make, and of declaring America, 
or any part of it, to be at peace, upon submission, and of inquiring into 
the state of America of any persons with whom they might think proper 
to confer, advise, converse, and consult, even although they should be 
officers of the army or members of Congress, and then representing the 
result of their inquiries to the ministry, wdio, after all, might or might 
not, at their pleasure, make any alterations in the former instructions 
to governors, or propose, in parliament, any alterations in the acts com- 
plained of. 

The whole affair of the commission appears to me, as it ever did, to 
be a bubble, an ambuscade, a mere insidious manoeuvre, calculated only 
to decoy and deceive, and it is so gross, that they must have a wretched 
opinion of our generalship to suppose that we can fall into it. 

The committee assured his Lordship, that they had no authority to 
wait upon him, or to treat or converse with him, in any other character 
but that of a committee of Congress, and as members of independent 
States; that the vote which was their commission, clearly ascertained 
their character; that the declaration which had been made of indepen- 
dence, was the result of long and cool deliberation ; that it was made by 
Congress, after long and great reluctance, in obedience to the positive 
instructions of their constituents, every Assembly upon the continent 



September, 17/6 93 

having instructed their delegates to this purpose, and since the declaration 
has been made and published, it has been solemnly ratified and confirmed 
by the Assemblies, so that neither this committee nor that Congress which 
sent it here, have authority to treat in any other character than as inde- 
pendent States. One of the committee, Dr. Franklin, assured his Lord- 
ship that, in his private opinion, America would not again come under 
the domination of Great Britain, and therefore that it was the duty of 
every good man, on both sides of the water, to promote peace, and an 
acknowledgment of American independency, and a treaty of friendship 
and alliance between the two countries. Another of the committee, 
Mr. J, A., assured his Lordship, that, in his private opinion, America 
would never treat in any other character than as independent States. 
The other member, Mr. Rutledge, concurred in the same opinion. His 
Lordship said he had no powers nor instructions upon that subject; it 
was entirely new. Mr. Rutledge observed to his Lordship that most of 
the colonies had submitted for two years to live without governments, and 
to all the inconveniences of anarchy, in hopes of reconciliation; but now 
they had instituted governments. Mr. J. A. observed that all the colonies 
had gone completely through a revolution; that they had taken all 
authority from the officers of the Crown, and had appointed officers of 
their own, which his Lordship might easily conceive had cost great 
struggles, and that they could not easily go back ; and that Americans had 
too much understanding not to know that, after such a declaration as they 
had made, the government of Great Britain never would have any con- 
fidence in them, or could govern them again but by force of arms.^

post. In his Autobiography (M^orks, III. 75) Adams gives the following account of 
the conference with Lord Howe and the subsequent proceedings in Congress : 

"Monday, September 9 

" On this day Mr. Franklin, Mr. Edward Rutledge, and Mr. John Adams, proceeded 
on their journey to Lord Howe, on Staten Island, the two former in chairs, and the latter 
on horseback. The first night we lodged at an inn in New Brunswick. On the road, and 
at all the public houses, we saw such numbers of officers and soldiers, straggling and 
loitering, as gave me, at least, but a poor opinion of the discipline of our forces, and 
excited as much indignation as anxiety. Such thoughtless dissipation, at a time so 
critical, was not calculated to inspire very sanguine hopes, or give great courage to 
ambassadors. I was, nevertheless, determined that it should not dishearten me. I saw 
that we must, and had no doubt but we should, be chastised into order in time 

" There were a few circumstances which appear neither in the Journals of Congress, 
nor in my letters, which may be thought by some worth preserving. Lord^Howe had 
sent over an officer as a hostage for our security. I said to Dr. Franklin, it would be 
childish in us to depend upon such a pledge, and insisted on taking him over with us, 
and keeping our surety on the same side of the water with us. My colleagues exulted 
in the proposition, and agreed to it instantly. We told the officer, if he held himself 
under our direction, he must go back with us. He bowed assent, and we all embarked 
in his lordship's barge. As we approached the shore, his lordship, observing us, came 
down to the water's edge to receive us, and, looking at the officer, he said, ' Gentlemen, 
j^ou make me a very high compliment, and you may depend upon it, I will consider it 
as the most sacred of things.' We walked up to the house between lines of guards of 
grenadiers, looking fierce as ten Furies, and making all the grimaces, and_ gestures, and 
motions of their muskets, with bayonets fixed, which, I suppose, military etiquette 
requires, but which we neither understood nor regarded. 

"The house had been the habitation of military guards, and was as dirty as a stable; 
but his lordship had prepared a large handsome room, by spreading a carpet of moss and

" I will now proceed to relate the sequel of this conference : ist, from the Journal of 
Congress ; 2d, from the letters written to some of my friends at the time ; 3d, a circum- 
stance or two, which are not preserved in the Journals or letters [Extracts from 

the Journals, Sept. 13 and 17, including the committee's report, which is quoted at 
length, are here omitted.] 

" Two or three circumstances, which are omitted in this report, and, indeed, not thought 
worth notice in any of my private letters, I afterwards found circulated in Europe, and 
oftener repeated than any other part of this whole transaction. Lord Howe was profuse 
in his expressions of gratitude to the state of Massachusetts, for erecting a marble monu- 
ment, in Westminster Abbey, to his elder brother, Lord Howe, who was killed in 
America, in the last French war, saying, ' he esteemed that honor to his family above 
all things in this world. That such was his gratitude and affection to this country, on 
that account, that he felt for America as for a brother, and. if America should fall, he 
should feel and lament it like the loss of a brother.' Dr. Franklin, with an easy air, 
and a collected countenance, a bow, a smile, and all that naivete, which sometimes 
appeared in his conversation, and is often observed in his writings, replied, ' My Lord, 
we will do our utmost endeavors to save your lordship that mortification.' His lordship 
appeared to feel this with more sensibility than I could expect ; but he only returned, ' I 
suppose you will endeavor to give us employment in Europe.' To this observation, not 
a word, nor a look, from which he could draw any inference, escaped any of the 
committee. 

â– ' Another circumstance, of no more importance than the former, was so much cele- 
brated in Europe, that it has often reminded me of the question of Phocion to his fellow- 
citizens, when something he had said in public was received with clamorous applause: 
' Have I said any foolish thing?' When his lordship observed to us that he could not 
confer with us as members of Congress, or public characters, but only as private persons 
and British subjects, Mr. John Adams answered somewhat quickly, 'Your lordship may 
consider me in what light you please, and, indeed, I should be willing to consider myself, 
for a few moments, in any character which would be agreeable to your lordship, except 
that of a British subject.' His lordship, at these words, turned to Dr. Franklin and 
Mr. Rutledge, and said, ' Mr. Adams is a decided character ', with so much gravity and 
solemnity, that I now believe it meant more than either of my colleagues, or myself, 
understood, at the time. In our report to Congress, we supposed that the commissioners. 
Lord and General Howe, had, by their commission, power to except from pardon all that 
they should think proper ; but I was informed, in England, afterwards, that a number 
were expressly excepted, by name, from pardon, by the Privy Council, and that John 
Adams was one of them, and that this list of exceptions was given, as an instruction, to 
the two Howes, with their commission." For other accounts of this interview see

.... The Congress determined yesterday that Commissioners should 
be appointed, to audit the Continental Accounts, in the Southern depart- 
men[t] and they are to proceed to day to the appointment of them.* The 
Virginia Accounts, that were tran[s]mitted to us some time ago, are to

135, The North Carolina Delegates to the North Carolina 

Council of Safety.* 

Cetitlemen 

We wrote the honourable the Council of Safety by Mr. Hayward who 
left this sometime since.^ We then inclosed you a Resolve of the Con- 
tinental Congress directing Brigadier General Moore with two of the 
Continental battalions which were raised in the State of North Carolina 
to proceed to New York with all possible expedition. A further Revision 
of that subject together with some private infoiTnation by letters of the 
present state of our Country have induced your delegates to obtain an 
alteration of that Resolve ; from which it will appear that the movement of 
our Troops is now left to the discretion of your honourable Body.' .... 

We need say nothing to you who have so well considered and digested 
the matters to induce you to compleat to their full number the Continental 
Battalions which have been raised in our State. The inclosed system 
agreed upon by Congress for the modelling a new Army * holds forth 
such encouragement that we flatter ourselves you will find no difficulty 
in carrying into execution that part of the plan which has been allotted 
to your share. The Bounty proposed is liberal and aided with the stimulus 
which every honest American does or ought to feel effectually to establish 
the liberties of America upon a pure and solid basis we hope to have an 
opportunity soon to congratulate you, that it has obtained for you an 
additional force which will effectually baffle the future efforts of our 
Enemies. 

You will observe that in addition to the six Regiments already raised 
by you, you are impowered to raise three more. Should you think your- 
selves inadequate to so large a number you will as early as possible repre- 
sent such your incapacity to Congress who will no doubt make such alter- 
ation as will suit your circumstances, tho' we hope that you will find no 
difficulty in complying with this Resolve to the full as you will no doubt 
be often called upon hereafter to aid the weakness of South Carolina and

William Bingham.^ 

Philadelphia, September 21, 1776. 
Sir: 

Your several letters of the 4th, I5tli, and 26th August, to this Com- 
mittee, have been duly received, with the several enclosures, and the whole 
have been laid before Congress.^ We can therefore communicate that 
satisfaction w^hich we dare say it must afford you to know, that you have 
so far obtained the approbation of that august body. 

It is not necessary that we should enter into minute replies to the con- 
tents of your letters ; therefore, we shall only notice such parts as seem 
to require it. 

Captain Wickes's * behaviour meets the approbation of his country, and 
fortune seems to have had an eye to his merit when she conducted his 
three prizes safely in. You made a very proper use of his engagement by 
your question to the General,* and it is extremely satisfactory that our 
prizes may be carried into and protected in the French ports ; but hitherto 
the Congress have not thought proper to entrust blank commissions 
beyond seas, neither can their resolve for bringing prizes into some of 
these States for condemnation, be dispensed with. These matters are now 
under consideration of a committee, and should any alteration take place, 
you shall be informed of it.^ .... 

5 The letter, written Sept. i8 ( ?), 19, 24, and 26, and signed by Hooper and Penn, 
is in N. C. Col. Recs., X. 810. It is largely concerning military matters. A more intimate 
letter, from Hooper to Samuel Johnston, dated Sept. 26, is ibid., X. 815. The same 
letter, dated Sept. 27, is in Jones, Defence of North Carolina, p. 321.

- The Journals contain no mention of this correspondence. It is probable how- 
ever that the letter laid before Congress by the committee of secret correspondence Aug. 
21 was Bingham's letter of Aug. 4. Bingham had been sent to Martinique by the secret 
committee in June (see no. 97, note 2, ayite) and resided there as the agent of Congress 
until near the close of the war, serving particularly as a medium of communication with 
France. Beginning in October. 1776, considerable correspondence with him is found in 
the collected Revolutionary correspondence. An important body of his correspondence 
has recently been acquired by the Library of Congress. A sketch of him is in Appleton,

We recommended the French officers that came with Captain Wickes 
to Congress, and the Board of War liave provided for them to their satis- 
faction.^ On this subject your remarks have been very proper; officers 
unacquainted with our language cannot be useful ; Â° therefore we do not 
wish to encourage such to come amongst us; at the same time, men of 
merit and abilities will always meet with suitable encouragement. You 
must therefore pursue the line you set out in ; give general discouragement 
to those that apply, and recommend none but such as the General will 
pledge his word for, and you may even intimate to him, that if too many 
come over, the Congress will not know what to do with them ''

In consequence of a letter from the President of Massachusetts Bay, 
dated the 13th instant, to the President of the Congress, which was by 
Congress referred to this Committee,^ we have determined to comply 
with the wishes of your Assembly by ordering the frigate commanded by 
Captain McNeill, and that by Captain Thompson, of New Hampshire, 
to be fitted immediately and proceed on a cruise on your coast, in hopes 
of taking the Millford frigate, or driving her or any other enemy away 
from those seas. We therefore authorize you to accept the proffered 
assistance of the said Assembly, or any Committee they appoint to assist 
in fitting, equipping, arming and manning that frigate. You are also 
to accept their offer of twenty-four nine-pounders cannon, and to coop- 
erate with them in getting the ship to sea with the utmost expedition ; and 
we agree to reimburse the State of Massachusetts Bay for all just and 
necessary expenses they incur in effecting this business.^ ....

September, ///d 99 

come to a determination to augment our Army, and to engage the Troops 
to serve during the War. As an Inducement to enhst on these Terms, the 
Congress have agreed to give, besides a Bounty of twenty dollars, a 
Hundred Acres of Land to each soldier; and in Case he should fall in 
Battle, they have resolved that his children, or other Representatives, 
shall succeed to such Land. 

The many ill consequences arising from a short and limited Inlistment 
of Troops, are too obvious to be mentioned.^ In general, give me leave to 
observe, that to make men well acquainted with the duties of a soldier, 
requires Time; and to bring them under proper subordination and Dis- 
cipline, not only requires time, but has always been a work of much 
difficulty. We have had frequent experience that men of a few days 
standing, will not look forward; but as the time of their discharge ap- 
proaches, grow careless of their arms, ammunition etc. and impatient of 
all Restraint. The Consequence of which is, the latter Part of the time 
for which the soldier engaged, is spent in undoing what the greatest Pains 
have been taken to inculcate at first. Need I add to this, that the Fall of 
the late General Montgomery before Quebeck is undoubtedly to be 
ascribed to the limited time for which the Troops were engaged, whose 
Impatience to return home, compelled him to make the attack, contrary 
to the conviction of his own Judgment. This Fact alone furnishes a 
striking Argument of the Danger and Impropriety of sending Troops 
into the field, under any Restriction as to the Time of their Inlistment. 
The noblest enterprise may be left unfinished by Troops in such a Predica- 
ment or abandoned at the very moment success must have crowned the 
attempt. 

The heavy and enormous expences consequent upon calling for the 
Militia, the Delay attending their Motions, and the Difficulty of keeping 
them in the Camp, render it extremely improper to place our whole 
dependence upon them. Experience hath uniformly convinced us of this, 
some of the Militia having actually deserted the Camp, at the very moment 
their services were most wanted. In the mean time the strength of the 
British Army which is great is rendered much more formidable by the 
Superior Order and Regularity which prevail in it. 

Under these circumstances, and in this Situation of our affairs, it is 
evident that the Only Means left us of preserving our Liberties, is the 
Measure which the Congress have now adopted, and which I am ordered 
most earnestly to recommend to you, to carry into immediate effect. 
Without a well disciplined Army, we can never expect success agst 
veteran Troops; and it is totally impossible w^e should have a well dis- 
ciplined Army, unless our Troops are engaged to serve during the war. 
To attain therefore this most desirable End, I am to request you will at 
once, and without a moments delay, bend all your attention to raise your 
Quota of the American army. The Times call for the greatest Dispatch 
and Vigour of Conduct. When the bloody Standard of Tyranny is 
erected in a land of Liberty, no good man, no Friend of his Country, can

possibly remain an inactive Spectator of her Fall. Display therefore, I 
most earnestly entreat you that Virtue which alone can Save her, on this 
occasion. Let us convince our enemies, that as we entered into the present 
contest for the Defence of our Liberties, so we are resolved, with the 
t'lrmest Reliance on Heaven for the Justice of our Cause, never to relin- 
quish it, but rather perish in the Ruins of it. If we do but remain firm, 
if we are undismayed at the little Shocks of Fortune, and are determined 
at all hazards that we will be free, I am persuaded, under the gracious 
smiles of Providence, assisted by our most strenuous endeavours, we shall 
finally succeed agreeably to our wishes, and thereby establish the Inde- 
pendence, the Happiness, and the glory of the United States of America. 
As the Troops now in service belonging to the several States, will be 
considered as part of their Quota in the American Army, you will please 
to take such steps as you judge necessary to ascertain what number of the 
Troops, as well as what Officers will engage to serve during the war. 
I send by this Express, blank Commissions, to be filled up with such as 
you shall please to appoint. I also forward a Number of the Rules and

Mr. Gerry delivered me a letter y**. sent by Major Cox; I have been 
a long time anxious to know the state of Gun Powder manufacture in 
our Government and have wrote repeatedly without being able to get any 
satisfactory information. We have had great success in making saltpetre, 
but witho^ great Care it will be all spoilt in making into Gunpowder, 
there have been some great instances here of miserable trash turn'd out 
for Gunpowder, which occasioned the Congress to appoint a Committee 
to enquire into the defect and procure a remedy.^ .... 

.... I am exceeding glad to find you turning yr. attention to this 
very important Manufacture. I hope you will not only make improve- 
ments in yr. own Works but communicate Knowledge to the other 
Powder makers and do what lays in yr Power to promote the manufac- 
ture of good Powder for it must be a most cruel Vexation in the day of 
decision for Liberty or Slavery to have the Scale turn against us meerly 
thro' the defect of our own Powder, this matter has lain as a Burthen on 
my mind and has caused me to apply great attention to this manufacture. 

Congress have passed some resolves to prevent the bad manufacture 
of Powder and also the importation of bad Powder, (for much Powder 
which has been imported from abroad has proved exceed [sic'\ bad) and 
have recommended inspectors to be appointed to prove all Powder, this 
matter should be carefully attended to. Majr. Cox will describe to you 
the machine by which we made most of our Experiments. You will 
excuse the freedom I take in addressing you thus freely when you consider 
the real importance of the subject. I wish the Inhabitants of the United 
States were more intent upon providing and manufacturing the Means 
of defence, than making Governments with^. providing for the means of

The Congress are resolved to raise Eighty eight Battalions to continue 
during the War we mean to re-inlist all those who are now engaged if 
they will serve. It is not intended by the Resolutions that you should 
raise Six Battalions over and above what you now have but that they 
should be re-inlisted to serve durinsf the war."

s Evidently the Articles of War, adopted Sept. 20. The task of revising the 
rules of war was assigned to the committee on spies June 14 (a committee consisting 
of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Edward Rutledge, James Wilson, and Robert R. 
Livingston, appointed June s). A report was brought in Aug. 19 and further considered 
Sept. 19. See no. 85, note 6, ante, and some remarks of Adams there quoted. Again, 
in his Autobiography, under the dates Sept. 19 and 20. he comments upon the Articles : 
" This was another measure that I constantly urged on with all the zeal and industry 
possible, convinced that nothing short of the Roman and British discipline could possibly 

save us 

" The articles are inserted in the Journal of this day, and need not be transcribed ; they 
are the system which I persuaded Jefferson to agree with me in reporting to Congress. 
They fill about sixteen pages of the Journal. In Congress, Jefferson never spoke, and 
all the labor of the debate on those articles, paragraph by paragraph, was thrown upon 
me, and such was the opposition, and so undigested were the notions of liberty prevalent 
among the majority of the members most zealously attached to the public cause, that 
to this day I scarcely know how it was possible that these articles could have been 
carried. They were adopted, however, and have governed our armies with little varia- 
tion to this day." Works, III. 83. 

* Apart from the Articles of War, Adams had been instrumental, according to 
his own statement, in bringing about the resolution in behalf of discipline passed Sept. 
19 (brought in by the board of war, in accordance with instructions, Sept. 18). 

" This resolution was the effect of my late journey through the Jerseys to Staten Island. 
I had observed such dissipation and idleness, such confusion and distraction among 
officers and soldiers, in various parts of the country, as astonished, grieved, and alarmed 
me. Discipline, discipline, had become my constant topic of discourse and even declama- 
tion in and out of Congress, and especially in the board of war. I saw very clearly that 
the ruin of our cause and country must be the consequence, if a thorough reformation 
and strict discipline could not be introduced. My zeal on this occasion was no doubt 
represented by my faithful enemies, in great secrecy, however, to their friends in the 
army; and although it might recommend me to the esteem of a very few, yet it will be 
easily believed that it contributed nothing to my popularity among the many." Ibid.

such officers in the Army here as he is desirous of having again engaged 
in the Service, wth. the States to wch. they belong and the General thinks 
it will be necessary to obtain the same from the northern Army. The 
use we intend to make of this is, to send it wth. a Member of Congress to 
the Assembly of each resj^ective State who is to be ordered to impress the 
Necessity of apix)inting Gentlemen of Education to military offices as a 
Measure absolutely necessary for saving the Country and to urge the 
Assemblies to apportion the Men on the Towns and raise them by recruit-

148. The President of Congress to Philip Schuyler.^ 

Philadelphia, September 27, 1776. 
Sir: 

I have the honour to enclose you sundry resolves, which are so explicit 
that I need only request your attention to them. 

You will perceive that Congress have come to a determination to aug- 
ment our army to eighty-eight battalions, and to engage the troops to 
serve during the continuance of the war, being thoroughly convinced by 
repeated instances that the short and limited inlistment of troops has 
been the source of much mischief to the service." 

In order that these troops may be better disciplined, the Congress have 
abolished the system of rules and articles for the government of the army 
which they at first instituted, and have adopted a new one, sundry copies of 
which I enclose you.^ 

* See the Journals. Sept. 16; also no. 148, post, and Washington's letter to

It is also their determination that the strictest discipline should be kept 
up in the army, that the soldiers should be daily trained and practised in 
their different manoeuvres. An attention to these things, you will observe 
by the enclosed resolves, will be the likeliest way to obtain promotion, and 
will be the surest recommendation to their notice.

army, etc., will set out to-morrow or next day for Tyconderoga.* To

It will, without question, be satisfactory.^

^ Most of Schuyler's letters for more than a month past had not been acted upon, 
and in a letter to President Hancock, Oct. 3 (Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser., II. 857), he 
complains bitterly at the neglect. For instance, his letter of Aug. i6 (Force, Am. Arch., 
fifth ser., I. 983) had been referred (Aug. 22) to the committee on the miscarriages in 
Canada (appointed June 24). Schuyler was so informed Sept. 14, and the committee 
reported Oct. 7, and then its report was laid on the table. Sept. 14, Schuyler sent in 
his resignation (Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.. III. 333). This letter, read Sept. 23, was 
acted on Oct. 2. Cf. no. 149, post. See Schuyler's reply to this letter, Oct. 6 (Force,

resolution of Congress was intended by Rutledge and other friends as an ample justifica- 
tion of Schuyler's conduct. See also Tuckerman, Life of Schuyler, ch. v.; Lossing,

Dear Sir 

.... The late resolution of congress for increasing our army to 
60,000 men will necessarily call for a number of new Brigadiers, and the 
proportion which Pennsylvania will send into the field will give her a 
right to demand one or two more for her Share. Merit like yours will 
weigh heavily with the congress but it must be held up in a pointed light 
to their view. Col. Magaw ^ tho' a younger Officer than you being near 
the congress, and having one or two eloquent friends in the house may 
perhaps be held up in colours that may injure your more just pretensions 
to promotion. 

ijpon this acct I beg leave to suggest to you that your friends in con- 
gress (among whom I desire to be classed) will derive great support 
from a few words in your favor from General Gates. You must not omit 
improving this hint to your advantage. And in everything relative to this 
matter I beg you will command my services. 

I should not have suggested these ideas to you, had I not more than 
once seen the most eminent military merit neglected in our promotions, 
from ignorance in the congress, or from the want of proper recommen- 
dations

Publick Bodys shou'd be equaly cautious of taking offence as of giving 
it, because mischiefs are very apt to arise therefrom and generally before 
a remedy can be applyed. You have taken amiss the refusal of fourteen 
p^ canvass wanted for your Colonial Vessells and had information that 
2000 p^ had been imported in one Vessell here. These are your premises 
and the Facts are as follow. It was not this Committee that refused you 
the canvass for we had agreable to orders of Congress delivered the 
whole to the Marine Committee and that whole consisted of about 600 p^ 
instead of 2000, but it was not possible the Marine Committee cou'd spare 
you a single Bolt, because the Congress had but a day or two before your 
application ordered all the light Duck and other Stuff, then in the Publick 
stores or that could be bought in the City to be made up into Tents and 
sent immediately to Genl. Washington, the Marine Committee remon- 
strated against this measure alledging that none of the Continental Ves- 
sells cou'd be sent out if this canvass was taken from them. No matter 
they were told the soldiers should have Tents if they stripped the Yards 
of those Continental Frigates and Cruizers that had sails made up, and 
in Consequence of this measure which nothing but the extream necessity 
of our Army cou'd justify, We have now a parcell of fine vessells lying 
here useless at a time they might have been most advantageously em- 
ployed. Therefore Judge you, whether that Committee or the Congress 
itself cou'd have justifyed sparing you the Canvass you wanted. You 
may depend Gentn. that no just grounds are ever meant to be given by 
Congress or any of its Committees for Complaints like yours. We are 
all embarked in a Cause that requires our utmost united exertions to carry

153. The Committee of Secret Corresponden'ce, Statement.* 

[October i, 1776.] 

Mr. Thomas Story,* who had been sent by the committee of secret 
correspondence. December 13, 1775, to France, Holland, and England, 
reported verbally as follows : 

" On my leaving London, Arthur Lee, esq., requested me to inform 
the committee of correspondence that he had several conferences with 
the French ambassador, who had communicated the same to the French 
court ; that, in consequence thereof, the Duke de Vergennes had sent a 
gentleman to Arthur Lee, who informed him that the French court could 
not think of entering into a war with England, but that they would assist 
America, by sending from Holland this fall Â£200,000 sterling worth of 
arms and ammunition to St. Eustatius, Martinique, or Cape Frangois; 
that application was to be made to the governors or commandants of those 
places, by inquiring for Monsieur Hortalez, and that, on persons properly 
authorized applying, the above articles would be delivered to them." 

Philadelphi.a, October i, 1776. 

The above intelligence w-as communicated to the subscribers, being the 
only two members of the committee of secret correspondence now in this 
city, and on our considering the nature and importance of it, we agree in 
opinion that it is our indispensable duty to keep it a secret, even from Con- 
gress, for the follow'ing reasons : 

(i) Should it get to the ears of our enemies at New York they would 
undoubtedly take measures to intercept the supplies, and thereby deprive 
us not only of those succors, but others expected by the same route. 

(2) As the court of France have taken measures to negotiate this loan 
and succor in the most cautious and most secret manner, should we divulge 
it immediately w-e may not only lose the present benefit, but also render 
that court cautious of any further connection wath such unguarded people, 
and prevent their granting other loans and assistance that we stand in need 
of and have directed Mr. Deane to ask of them, for it appears from all our 
intelligence they are not disposed to enter into an immediate w'ar with 
Britain, though disposed to support us in our contest with them ; we there- 
fore think it our duty to cultivate their favorable disposition tow'ards us, 
draw from them all the support we can, and in the end their private aid 
must assist us to establish peace or inevitably draw them in as parties to 
the war. 

(3) We find, by fatal experience, the Congress consists of too many 
members to keep secrets, as none could be more strongly enjoined than the 
present embassy to France ; notwithstanding which Mr. Morris was this 
day asked by Mr. Reese Meredith ^ whether Dr. Franklin and others were

really going- ambassadors to France, which plainly proves that this com- 
mittee ought to keep this secret, if secrecy is required. 

(4) We are of opinion that it is unnecessary to inform Congress of this 
intelligence at present, because Mr, Morris belongs to all the committees 
that can properly be employed in receiving and importing the expected sup- 
plies from Martinico, and will influence the necessary measures for that 
purpose; indeed, we have already authorized William Bingham, esq., to 
apply at Martinico and St. Eustatia for what comes there, and remit part 
by the armed sloop Independence, Captain Young, promising to send others 
for the rest. Mr. Morris will apply to the marine committee to send other 
armed vessels after her, and also to Cape Frangois (without communicat- 
ing this advice) , in consequence of private intelligence, lately received, that 
arms, ammunition, and clothing can now be procured at those places. But, 
should any unexpected misfortune befall the States of America, so as to 
depress the spirits of Congress, it is our opinion that, on any event of that 
kind, Mr. Morris (if Dr. Franklin should be absent) should communicate 
this important matter to Congress, otherwise keep it until part of or the 
whole supplies arrive, unless other events happen to render the communica- 
tion of it more proper than it appears to be at this time.*

* The following passage in a letter from John Jay to Robert Morris, written from 
Fishkills, Oct. 6, is pertinent here: "I wish the Secret Committee would communicate 
no other intelligence to the Congress at large, than what may be necessary to promote 
the common weal, not gratify the curiosity of individuals. I hint this because a copy 
of a letter from A. L. to that Committee has lately been sent by a member of Congress 
to a gentleman of his acquaintance who is not a member of Congress. I came by this 
intelligence in such a way as to speak with certainty, for I have seen the copy, but at 
the same time in such a way as not to be able with propriety to mention names. You 
will be pleased therefore to make no other use of this information than to induce the 
greater caution in the Cornmittee. For as to binding certain members in the house to 
secresy by oaths or otherwise would be just as absurd as to swear Lee (no matter which 
of them) to look or feel like Ned Rutledge." Correspondence of Jay (ed. Johnston), I.

Gentlemen, 

The many and just Complaints of the Insufficiency of the Surgeons and 
their Mates, to discharge their Duty in a proper Manner, have induced 
Congress to pass the enclosed Resolves, recommending it to the several 
States to appoint some skilful Physicians as Examiners; without whose 
Approbation, no Surgeon, or Surgeon's Mate, shall receive a Commission 
either in the Army or Navy.^ 

The Congress being at present deeply engaged in Alatters of the utmost 
Importance to the Welfare of America, have judged it absolutely neces- 
sary that there should be a full Representation of the several States as 
soon as possible. For this End, I am to request, in Obedience to their 
Commands, you will immediately take proper Measures to comply with 
the enclosed Resolve, in Order that the United States may be fully repre- 
sented in Congress, and the Sentiments of America be the better known 
upon those interesting Subjects that lie before them.^ I shall therefore 

William Hooper were inserted after that of Robert Morris (above the line), but they 
were afterward so carefully erased that they can now barely be made out. Inasmuch as 
both Lee and Hooper appear to have been in Congress Oct. i (both received committee 
appointments that day), it is not at all clear why their names should not have been 
included in this certificate, as members of the committee of secret correspondence then 
present, or why they should not have signed, until Oct. lo and ii, the committee's com- 
pact of secrecy drawn up Oct. i (see no. 153, ante). 

3 In the letter of the committee of secret correspondence to William Bingham, 
Sept. 21 (the part written Oct. i; see no. 136, note 7, ante), is this statement: "We 
also enjoin you to the strictest secrecy, and herewith enclose you two separate letters 
as your proper authority for receiving any goods or money Monsieur Hortalez, our 
agent in Europe, may remit." The two letters are doubtless this certificate and the 
letter of the same date to Bingham, to which the certificate appears to be appended 
(Force, Ant. Arch., fifth ser., II. 822, 823).

My dear Robert, 

The day before I rec'd your last favor I wrote you a few lines ^ request- 
ing that you Jay and Schuyler would immediately come hither upon busi- 
ness of great importance. Since which we have rec'd a letter from your 
Convention ^ relative to the last gentleman whose fate has been hard 
indeed. However his spirited conduct and the support which your body 
seem determined to give him w-ill I trust have a proper effect upon Con- 
gress and make him respectful even in the eyes of his enemies. The 
enclosed resolution * which I drew and which passed the House unani- 
mously will justify the conjecture. It will be a farther satisfaction to 
you to know that upon the receipt of your Convention's letter, when some 
of us took the opportunity of applauding his (Sr's) conduct in high 
terms, no man could be found to say any thing against him. Let him not 
im.agine from this, that the members are all his friends, this is not to 
be expected nor do I know that it is to be desired ;....! moved Con- 
gress yesterday and they accordingly directed all absent members to 
attend.* Our Confederation has been neglected for many many w^eks 
because the States have been unrepresented. Necessity requires that it 
be immediately past. If I am not much mistaken the salvation of your 
State depends upon something being soon done in this business.* We 
have great reason to think that the Quakers have determined to refuse 
our Continental Currency. If they make a point of it, we must make a 
point of hanging them, which will bring on a storm that will take the 

wisdom of all our wise men to direct I must forego the pleasure 

of telling you what past between Lord Howe and your hble. servt. it is 
too long for the compass of a letter. Delay was my object. I wish we 
could have procrastinated matters until we could have procured more

^Although Gerry's letter contains no address, internal evidence shows that it

Sept. 23, found in Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, II. 447, contains the inquiry to which 
Gerry evidently alludes in the second paragraph of his letter : " I should have been glad

to inform Adams that Franklin, Jefferson, and Deane have been chosen commissioners 
to the court of France (see the Journals, Sept. 26).

This for your private Satisfaction therefore not to be mentioned Yet. 
Your private Satisfaction, Did I say? in this I may be wTong, not know-

War; or Whether if you were so inclined, as the Congress have left it to 
the several Assemblies to appoint all the Officers, Except General Officers.

Dear Sir 

As I have not been able for some time to attend the marine Committee 
I last Saturday took the liberty to show Mr Morrice ^ your letters Con- 
cerning the Conduct of the Providence Committee about Guns and soon 
found Mr Hancock thro the multiplicity of Business had not laid the 
affair before the Marine Committee Mr Morrice resented their Conduct 
extremely and Desired liberty to lay the letter before Congress but as I 
was uncertain but some bad Effect might arise from laying it before the 
whole Congress I Declined it He then Desired liberty to lay it before 
the Marine Committee to which I Consented He said he would Do his 
utmost that your ship should have them Guns at Providence and without 
paying that Enormous price for them I am in hopes them guns will be 
ordered for your ship and one of theirs ordered to wait till guns can be 
sent from here where, they are Contracted for at 35 and 40 pound this 
money pr tun ' 

I believe (inter nos) your letters to the President Concerning marine 
affairs have not been laid before the Committee nor much attention been 
paid them the great and important Business in which he is Constantly 
employed and the almost immense number of letters which he is Con- 
stantly receiving on the most interesting subjects makes it impossible for 
him to attend to them all and lesser matters must be neglected I sincerely 
wish he did not belong to the Marine Committee but would Confine him- 
self to the affairs of Congress which is Business abundantly sufficient to 
employ the time of any one human being.* ....

Philadelphia, October 7, 1776. 
Gentlemen: 

.... The Committee of Congress to whom your papers respecting 
General Schuyler were committed, have reported, we hope to your satis- 
faction. Mr. Rutledge informs us that he had transmitted a copy to 
Robert R. Livingston, Esq., and a certified copy shall be sent you per 
post, which will probably come to your hands before this letter.^ 

On the 5th instant we were going to move Congress, that they would 
direct General Washington to propose to General Howe the exchange of 
Brigadier-General Woodhull for Brigadier-General McDonald, when a 
Pennsylvania newspaper of same date was handed to us, by which it 
would appear that Brigadier-General Woodhull had taken such a part as 
would put it out of our power to move for his exchange. Should be glad 
you would inform us if there be any truth in this conjecture, and direct 
us as to our conduct therein.' 

We are respectfully, gentlemen, your very humble servants,

Dear Sir 

I have just rccd your Favours of 3(1 and 7th Inst* and am at a Loss to 
know wliat is meant by " supplying' the army by Contract ". I have never 
heard a proposal of the Kind made in Conc^ress; if such a plan has been 
agitated It was in my absence.* the Comm^ exerted themselves to return 
to Congress and make their report. It has now been under Consideration 
four Days and the part that respects your powers contains sufficient pro- 
vision for your purposes, but has not yet been considered.^ I suppose the 
Congress will have no objection to making you a generous Allowance for 
your services when the Matter can be properly agitated, but a Multiplicity 
of Business and not an apprehension that the Measure cannot be carryed, 
has prevented a Determination of it before this. It will be proposed when 
several Important Alatters are finished, and I hope to your Satisfaction, 
if not and You resign, It is probable to me that Congress will supply the 
Army by Contract. For my own part I have sacrificed Ease and Interest 
to the Liberties of America, and am fully convinced that unless a general 
Determination prevails to establish it at every Expense and Hazard, 
Slavery and inevitable Ruin must be the Consequence. I could wish 
therefore that a Determination had taken place in your Mind to have 
sustained the office of Commissary General without annexing the Con- 
ditions mentioned, since Congress must exercise an unbiassed Judgment 
in determining the Quantum meruit of all their officers or surrender the 
purse strings of the Continent to those who are employed in its Services â€” 
a Measure that would soon end in the ruin of all. I am the more desirous 
of this as your Friends would not be the less attentive to your Merits, and 
as Your present plan may end in the Introduction of an officer to suc- 
ceed vou who mav dissatisfv the Armv, yea cause it to be disbanded and 
risk the loosing America. These are my Sentiments on the Matter but 
shall nevertheless endeavour to have the Affair properly regulated and 
the most generous Allowances made for your services.* my Complimts.

Philadelphia Octr. 9th. 1776 
Dear Sir, 

I wrote you about 10 days ago ^ from the Camp at Harlem, and since 
my return to this City, find that the Committee of Congress to enquire 
into the state of your affairs at Tyconderoga are empowered to make 
Contracts for supplying your Army. What gave rise to this matter I have 
not yet learnt, but it counteracts a measure of having it supplied by the 
Commissary General, which has alone proved salutary in that department. 
I suspect it originates from Tory influence, and that if any alteration is 
made, the Committee not knowing or being intimately acquainted with 
the characters of the persons who are desirous of the place, will introduce 
a person that will put the Northern Army in the same ruinous situation 
heretofore experienced. For God's sake then use your influence to 
prevent new schemes at this critical juncture, if no great inconveniences 
are felt from the present mode of supplies.^ ....

and rank of ist Lieut.^ since that, on an exceeding, most laborious and 
warmly spirited Debate that ever I was Witness to, They have added, 
an annual Suit of Cloaths to the non Com : Officers and Soldiers to the 
value and amount of twenty Dollars, and the man procuring a Certificate 
from his Capt. that He is provided with the enumerated Articles will be 
entitled to the 20 Dols in Cash. This is the very utmost that can possibly 
be obtained and certainly is as much as can be reasonably wishd or desired, 
and I am sure it is a very large and sufficient Encouragemt., and as much 
as it is possible for the Continent to support. New England pressed it to 
the utmost of their Power and were but just able to carry it, but They 
wo^ not wdsh to add another farthing. 

to save great Delay and Inconvenience, a Resolve is also pasd 
recomending it to all the States from this to N. H. inclusive forthwith to 
send a Com*^. or Deputies to each of the Camps, and appoint all the 
Officers, etc. and to consult the Genl officers abt. it and promote and

a .little before, viz., with the pay and rations of a captain and rank of first lieutenant.

now at Chester, immediately to Trentown, there to wait your Excellencys commands; 
and at the same time to acquaint you of the Situation of the People of this State, that 
having as comprehensive a View of the State of Affairs as possible you may make such 
Disposition as the good of the Service may require. 

" The Council of Safety of this State requested some days since a Conference with 
this Board in Order to lay before it a Representation of their Situation, and Expectations. 
In the course of this Conference it appeared very clearly, that they were in a most defence- 
less Condition, that they had no works upon the River except one Fort unfinished, that 
the Militia of this City are inactive and languid to the last Degree and to close their 
distress a number of the People of this Place were disaffected. Indeed they went so 
far as to say that in their Judgement a large party might be found to espouse openly the 
Cause of the Enemy should our Affairs run retrograde at New York. As your Excel- 
lency, however, must know more of your own Strength and your own intended Operations 
then [sic] Congress possibly can, and as it is of the greatest importance that you should 
be Supported at all Events General Stephens with the Virginia forces will take post at 
Trentown in Order to obey such Commands as you may be pleased to give him." Library

Dear Sir, 

Among the inconveniences of this busy scene, I esteem it not the least 
to be so often prevented from acknowledging- the favors of my friends 
sooner than I do. It has been owing to much business that your letter of 
the 27th. has not received an answer before now. I have the pleasure to 
acquaint you that in ranking the Captains of our Continental Ships, the 
Congress have placed Captain Nicholson at the head, he being the first 
Captain.- I wish it were in my power to give you a satisfactory answer 
about the building another Frigate. Hitherto nothing has been determined 
on this subject, the Committee having been prevented by an infinite 
nuiltiplicity of other business; and to the same cause has it been owing 
that no orders have been sent concerning the Frigate Virginia. I have 
no doubt but that another Frigate will soon be directed, and that the 
Builder of greatest merit will be prefer'd. It would give me the greatest 
pleasure to hear that the Virginia was ready for Sea, and I am happy in 
being satisfied that the Managers of this business in Baltimore will not 
loose a moment in eflecting so salutary a work. I suppose a want of 
Anchors will be the greatest obstruction, as I take it for granted no time 
will be lost in getting the guns down from Mr. Hughes's works, and 
having the Carriages made. I shall be glad to have an exact state of the 
Frigate and what she wants to complete her. I refer you to the papers 
for news and am Sir Your most obedient servant

this Barrier once removed, military Power would quickly spread Desola-

the absolute Necessity of filling up the Army, of providing for the Troops, 
and engaging them to serve during the War, is so apparent, and has been 
so frequently urged, that I shall only request your Attention to the 
Resolves of Congress on this Subject; and beseech you, by that Love you

Dear Sir: 

.... Yesterday, the Committee appointed to hear the appeal from the 
Maritime Court in New Hampshire, concerning the Elizabeth, made their 
report, which was accepted. Ihey have reversed the sentence of our 
court, and have ordered a salvage of one-tenth part to be paid by the 
claimants, as she did not come under the order of Congress of November 
and December last. Afterwards, the Congress, by a vote, gave up to the 
said claimants their share of the said tenth, so that they will have but one- 
twentieth part to pay, besides the costs. - 

The same Committee have had Mr. Sheafe's petition under their con- 
sideration, but have made no report. By what I have conversed with 
them, I believe they will not think themselves authorized to do any thing 
in that afifair, as there is no appeal from the court to the Congress, and 
the opposite party not present to be heard in the case, and nothing but the 
petition, without any thing more before them. They all say the case 
appears to be hard, but know not how to remedy it, without more proofs 
than they have at present, and without the opposite party being heard, 
and the case brought properly before them. 

Before this reaches you, you will see the several orders of the Marine 
Committee about guns for your ship, and the reasons of those orders. 
The rank of the Captains is settled.^ Captain Thompson is the sixth.

to resign : whether his resignation will be accepted, or his rank altered,

wages to the seamen agreeable to the resolve of Congress. They informed 
me they had not given any orders about it, and that it was not in their 
power to give any orders different from the resolves of Congress, yet it 
seemed to be the desire of the Committee that such passengers and seamen 
as behaved themselves decently should be dealt well by, and not stripped 
of every thing that might be taken from them by the rules of war

Since my last your Friend Mr W ^ in Consequence of an order of 

Congress directing the Board of War to consider an Application of 
Mr Harrison Dep. pay. Gen. for the southern Department and of your 
Brother for the northern that their Salaries may be augmented,^ moved 
that the Board may at the same Time consider the Salary of the Commis- 
sary General and report an Augmentation. I confess that I was not less 
puzled than surprized at this injudicious Measure, taken previous to a 
Consultation of your Friends in Congress, at an unfavourable Time, and 
proposing the Consideration of this Matter for Gentlemen whose Senti- 
ments would in all probability be against it. had the Motion not been 
seconded It might have passed over without prejudice, untill a favorable 
Oppertunity should offer for looking into the Reasonableness of your 
Expectations ; but Mr H * adopting it from friendly Motives pro- 
duced an Opposition that at once prevented a Committment. Nothing 
remains to be done but your stating in a Petition to Congress the princi- 
ples upon wch. you ground your Request for an augmentation and praying 
for the same ; if this is done with Reason and Coolness and supported by 
the opinion of the General who has spoken in Favour of the Measure." 
I have no Doubt that It will be favourably reed. As the Salary which 
you now have, compared with others of the Staf, is very large, Congress 
will expect to have it demonstrated that the army is better supplyed and 
at less Expence in the present Mode than It would probably be by Con- 
tract ; and with respect to the Method of paying the Commissary It must 
be left with Congress without any proposals in the petition for this 
purpose.Â® 

I could wish that your Friend aforesd. had not medled with the Matter, 
as his observations on it have only served to injure the Cause; but that 
cannot be now remedied.

The Congress liaving done the Board of War the Honour of referring 
to them your Letter for Consideration and execution,* we beg Leave to 
inform you that we have ordered two hundred Thousand Cartridges to 
be instantly forwarded to you. Light Waggons have been got and are 
getting ready and you will receive the above supply by Tomorrow Eve- 
ning or the next Morning. We have employed Persons to make up a 
Quantity for the use of the Army, which shall be forwarded to your Care 
as soon as a proper Number shall be compleated. We cannot however 
but wish that General Washington could procure such supplies of Ammu- 
nition as he may want, from the Eastern States, there being very little in 
this City, from whence alone every Demand to the Southward of Hud- 
son's River must be answer'd. Every Assistance however that can be 
shall be afforded you as well as his Excellency the General from this Office. 



177. Benjamin Rush to [Thomas Morris ?].^ 

Philadelphia, October 22, 1776. 

.... I will add only an anecdote to the honor of the bearer of this 
letter. I had the honor to be seated near him in Congress at the moment 
w'hen he was appointed to depart immediately for your court, and, upon 
my complimenting him thereon, he said to me : " I have only a few years 
more to live and I am resolved to employ them in whatever manner my 
countrymen judge proper ; or, as the old clothes dealers say, speaking of 
a scrap of cloth, ' you shall have me for what you please '." ^ 

[176]^ Copied from the original then in possession of Mr. Stan. V. Henkels of Phila- 
delphia. The same letter is in Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser., II. 1185, but printed as if 
to Washington.

77. fol. 263. The letter is labeled " Bush a Morris. Traduite de I'anglais (interceptee)"'. 
The letter is evidently from Benjamin Rush and presumably to Thomas Morris. It is 
here retranslated from the French. 

2 The bearer of the letter was Benjamin Franklin, who had been named, Sept. 26, 
one of the commissioners to the court of France. The incident is also recorded by 
Rush in his estimate of Franklin included in his Memorial (p. iii) : "I sat next to him 
in Congress, when he was elected by the unanimous vote of every State in the Union 
to an embassy to the Court of France in the year 1776. When the vote was declared, 
I congratulated him upon it. He thanked me, and said, ' I am like the remnant of a 
piece of unsaleable cloth. You may have it, as the shopkeepers say for what you please '." 
In reply to a caution of David Hartley (Apr. 23, 1778), to take care of his own safety, 
Franklin uses the same simile, although in varied language {Writings, ed. Smyth, 
VII. 143).

1st Octr.- by the sloop Independence, Capt. Young, to Martinico, from 
whence they would be carried to you by Mr. William Hodge, junr. sent

tions from Congress to their Commissioners, authorizing them to Treat 
with other nations; also Two Resolves of Congress, by one of which you 
would sec that Thomas Jefferson, Esqr., declined his appointment, and 
that Arthur Lee, Esqr., was appointed in his stead, to whom we inclosed 
a letter. Copy whereof goes herewith.* By the other, the Commissioners 
are directed to hire or buy Eight Line-of-Battle ships for the American 
Service." these papers were sent under Cover to William Bingham, Esqr., 
our Resident at Martinico, with orders to forward them immediately.' 
We wrote you another letter yesterday ^ covering duplicates of all the 
papers and letters mentioned herein, and sent it by the armed Brig^ Lex- 
ington, Wm Hallock. Esqr., Commander, to Mr. Stephen Ceronio, our 
Resident at Cape Franc^ois, with directions to forward the same to Messrs. 
Saml and J. Hans Delap, merchts, at Bordeaux who are requested to 
send the Packet from thence by Express to you, and Doctr. Franklin 
carries with him Triplicates of all these publick papers, we have been 
thus particular in mentioning them and the conveyances by which they 
were sent that you may know when the whole are received and we desire 
you to be equally pointed in advising us thereof, for we shall be anxious 
to hear of their getting safe and shall be very uneasy if we don't hear this 
in due time, for they ought not on any account to fall into the hands of 
our Enemies. 

Since Mr. Dickinson and Colo. Harrison were out of Congress and 
Doctr. Franklin appointed one of the Commissioners at the Court of 
France, the Congress have filled up the Vacancys in this Committee, and 
the members now are Mr. Jay, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Morris, Colo. Richd 
Henry Lee, Mr. Wm Hooper, and Dr. John Witherspoon, which we 
mention for your information.* we shall continue to address all our 
advices and dispatches to you only, untill informed that the other Com- 
missioners have joined you but you will Communicate the letters to them 
as if directed to the whole, and we depend on you to notify Doctr. Lee of 
his appointment using the utmost precaution in the method of doing it, 
or his person may be endangered, we suppose it may be best to have the 
letter inclosed by the ministers of France to their Ambassador in England 
with proper cautions respecting the delivery of it. Doctr. Franklin 
being the bearer of this letter, it is totally unnecessary for us to enter into 
any detail of what is passing here or to convey any Political remarks, 
he being possessed of every knowledge necessary for your information, 
will communicate very fully everything you can wish to know. Therefore,

Commissioners in Paris.^ 

PhiladelphiaOctober 24th 1776. 
Gentlemen 

The Congress having committed to our charge and management their 
ship of war called the Reprisal ^ commanded by Lambert Wickes, Esqr., 
carrying sixteen six pounders and about one hundred and tw^enty men We 
have allotted her to carry Doctor Franklin to France and directed Capt 
Wickes to proceed for the Port of Nantes where the Doctor will land and 
from thence proceed to Paris, and he will either carry with him or send 
forward this letter by express as to him may then appear best 

In Consequence of this plan for the Reprisal's Cruize we desire you to 
make immediate application to the court of France to Grant the Protec- 
tion of their Ports to American Men of War and their Prizes. Shew 
them that British Men of War under Sanction of an Act of Parliament 
are daily Capturing American Ships and Cargoes. Shew them the 
Resolves of Congress for making Reprisals on British and West India 
property and that our Continental Men of War and numerous private 
Ships of War are most successfully employed in executing those Resolu- 
tions of the Congress. Shew them the Justice and equity of this proceed- 
ing and surely they can not, they wall not refuse the protection of their 
Ports to American Ships of War, Privateers and their prizes. If your 
application on this head is crowned with success, try another which it is 
their interest to grant, that is to obtain leave to make Sale of those Prizes 
and their Cargoes or any part thereof that may be suitable for that 
Country. If you succeed in this also, you must appoint some person to 
act as judge of the Admiralty, who should give the Bond prescribed for 
those Judges to determine in all Cases agreable to the Rules and Regula- 
tions of Congress, and for this purpose we will report to Congress some 
Resolves vesting you with authority to make such appointment and 
authorizing such judge to condemn without a jury as required here; ' if

correspondence in consequence of the resolutions of Oct. 11. See no. 178, note 2, ante; 
also letters of the marine committee to Captain Wickes, Sept. 21, Oct. 24, Force, Am. 
Arch., fifth ser., II. 429, 1213, 1215. 

3 It does not appear that such resolves were enacted by Congress. See however 
nos. 252, 274, post; also article XIX. of the treaty with France (the Journals, May 4, 
1778), and a letter from Franklin and Deane to the committee of secret correspondence, 
Mar. 12, 1777 (Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 287).

these Resolves are agreed to by Congress, they shall be immediately trans- 
mitted to you ; if they are not that plan must drop and the Prizes must all 
proceed for America for condemnation. You can in the mean time con- 
sult the ministers whether they will permit such Courts in France and in 
the French West India islands. If protection is granted to our Cruizers 
and their Prizes you will immediately procure proper orders to be sent to 
the officers of all their Ports on this subject, and write yourselves to those 
Houses we have named at the several Ports that the Prizes are to remain 
for Cap Wickes's further orders, also lodge such orders with proper 
persons at the other Ports in France. On the Contrary if the Prizes are 
not to be protected in their Ports then give immediate notice to all those 
Houses and proper persons at the other Ports to furnish the Prizes that 
Cap Wickes of the Reprisal may send into their port with any necessarys 
the Prize Master may judge they stand in need of and to order him 
immediately to make the best of his way with the Prize to the first safe 
Port he can make in the United States of America lodge advice also for 
Cap Wickes at Bordeaux, Brest and Nantes whether his Prizes are to be 
protected in Port or not and whether or not any sales will be permitted. 
If they are protected he can take his own time to Collect and bring them 
Home under his own Convoy ; if any sale is permitted, he can sell perish- 
able commodities and Vessels unfit for so long a voyage as to this Coast. 
If no protection for Prizes they will be come away by your orders and 
need not stay for his, and if they deny Protection to our Cruizers them- 
selves, he will only remain in Port for your advices and to obtain such 
supplies as may be necessary. We have recommended Cap Wickes to take 
on board his own Ship as many Valuable Commodities as he can if he is 
successful but should he be unsuccessful in Cruizing then Messrs. Pliarne 
and Co. may put some Goods on board when he is coming away. You 
will readily see the Tendency these measures have, and as their conse- 
quences may be very important so we hope your attention to them will be 
immediate and Constant whilst necessary. 

Captain Wickes is a worthy man as such we recommend him and 
shoud he have the misfortune to be taken or meet wuth any other mis- 
fortune we hope you will adopt measures for his relief. He will treat 
Prisoners with Humanity and we are Convinced his Conduct will do 
honor to his appointment. We have the honor to be Gentn.

Companies Receiving more Rations than they are entitled to ; an evil 
which has been complained of perhaps with too much Foundation. 

It frequently happens that Sick Soldiers are either left behind at Posts 
or Places thro' which their Regiments or companies are marching, or 
they are sent to Hospitals at a Distance from their Corps. These unhappy 
People, or Some of them, are often thought unable and discharged by the 
Director or Surgeon of the Hospital as unfit for Service, and turned out 
to beg their Subsistence to their Homes or Places of their former Res- 
idence, altho' they may have Pay due to them Sufficient to Support them. 
This not only raises Compassion and from this Motive should be remedied, 
but is extremely detrimental to the Service, by deterring others from 
enlisting. 

The Board therefore have thought that the Soldiers, so discharged, 
should have it in their Power to recieve their Pay in whatever Part of 
the States they may be ; and have accordingly formed a Plan to enable 
them to do it, and request your Excellency's advice on both these 
Subjects.^

" That each Regiment Troop or Company be mustered either by the Muster master- 
Genl. or his Deputies Times in every Year if the Situation of the Army will admit 
thereof and that the Muster Mr Genl. or his Deputies, shall return exact accounts 
thereof monthly to the Commanders in Oiief of the several Departments, and furnish 
Copies of such returns to the Adjutant and Commissary General or their Deputies. 

"That the Commissary Genl. or his Deputies shall return to the Adjutant General or 
his Deputies monthly an exact Account of all Rations drawn by each Regimt. Troop or 
Company in the Course of the Month and the said Adjutant General or his Deputies 
shall return the same to the Commander in Chief of the several Departments to be trans- 
mitted to Congress as part of the General Returns of the Army. 

" That the Captains or Comrs of every Troop or Company shall, at the Time a sick 
non comd. Officer or Soldier shall go to the Hospital send with such sick non comd. 
Officer or Soldier an exact Account of what pay is due him and in case of Discharge 
from the Hospital as unfit for farther Service the Director or Surgeon of such Hospital 
shall certify what Pay is due the Non comd. Officer or Soldier so discharged. And the 
Captain or Comander of the Troop or Company out of which such Officer or Soldier 
shall go to the Hospital shall not receive the Pay of any Officer or Soldier so sick or 
discharged; but such Non Comd. Officer or Soldier shall be paid at any Pay Office or 
Place by any Person in the United States authorized to pay the Continental Troops on 
producing such Certificates which shall be kept as vouchers by the Person so paying 
and Copies thereof delivered to the Officer or Soldier receiving his Pay." 

Washington's reply to the board's inquiry has not been found. The board made a 
report Nov. 13, and on Nov. 19, upon the further consideration of the report, some 
resolutions on these subjects were adopted. See the Journals.

cluding there must be a fault somewhere, and if not in General Wooster, 
it would naturally fall on him. His conclusion was ill founded. The 
Congress, when they cleared General Wooster of misconduct, never 
thought of laying it on General Schuyler, but imputed the miscarriage 
there to the short time the soldiers had inlisted for, the small-pox getting 
into the amiy, the want of hard money to purchase provisions in Canada, 
and the almost impossibility of transporting any quantity there in the

Philadelphia October 27, 1776. 
Dear Sir 

I find by your letter of the 5th Inst, you had not received one of my 
letters wrote in answer to one of yours. I kept no Copy of it which youl 
say is unusual for a merchant. I acknowledge it and only plead in excuse, 
that I did not write to you in that Character. The letter for Mrs. Gates 
is gone forward by Post, as I cou'd not meet any other Conveyance, altho 
I kept it here some days in expectation of one. Mr. Johnston, and indeed 
all the Maryland Delegates, are at home forming a Constitution. This 
seems to be the present business of all America, except the Army, it is 
the fruits of a certain premature declaration which you know I always 
opposed, my opposition was founded in the evil consequences I foresaw 
or thought I foresaw, and the present state of several Colonies justifys my 
apprehensions. We are disputing about Liberties, Priviledges, Posts, and 
places, at the very time we ought to have nothing in View but the securing 
those objects and placing them on such a footing as to make them worth 
contending for amongst ourselves hereafter; but instead of that, the 
Vigour of this and several other States is lost in Intestine division, and, 
unless this spirit of Contention is checked by some means or other, I fear 
it will have banefull influence on the general measures of America. 

I am not one of those Testy Politicians that run resty when my own 
plans are not adopted, for I think it the duty of a good Citizen to follow 
when he cannot lead, and happy wou'd it be for America if all her 
Inhabitants wou'd adopt this Maxim, and make it an invariable rule 
during this great Contest for the Minority on every question to submit to, 
and Cooperate with, the Majority, but alas this cannot be it is not to be 
expected from Human Nature. We must take men as we find them, and

Neglect or SHg-ht meant to you or the departnicnt you Act in. it is 
deemed of the utmost importance, and all the Members of Congress wish 
that and every other deiKirtment was duly attended to; but the Fact is 
they have too many objects and retain too much executive business in 
their own hands for their Members to efTect with that vigor and dispatch 
that is necessary.* 

You say I must tell you gfood News. I will if you will repay me in 
kind for of late we have had nothing but very bad News from both our 
Army's. Wq expect daily to hear of your being attacked and have 
sanguine hopes of a Vigorous and successful! defence on your part, 
much depends on it. if you keep your Ground I think Genl. Washington 
will keep his and if both do this for the present Fall and ensuing Winter, 
the Good News I mean to tell you will be verifyed. 

It is that the French are undoubtedly disposed to assist us in this Con- 
test, and I have little doubt but they will take part in the War next 
Summer, indeed it seems to me impossible but all Europe will be involved 
in War and, if so, Great Britain will have her hands full, and probably 
be glad to render justice and reparation to the Country she has so much 
injured. 

Nothing do I wish for more than a peace on terms honorable and bene- 
ficial to both Country's; and I am convinced it is more Consistent with 
the Interest of Great Britain to acknowledge our Independency and enter 
into Commercial Treatys with us than to persist in attempting to reduce 
us to unconditional submission. I hope we shall never be reduced to 
[that] vile situation whilst a true friend to America and freedom exists, 
life W'ill not be worth having and it is better to perish by the sword than 
drag out the remaining days in misery and scorn; but I hope Heaven 
has better things in store for the Votaries of so just a Cause.

a single Letter. As your Letters may be of the utmost Consequence, and 
the Enemy may derive great Advantages from the knowledge of their

I have judg'd it proper without waiting for the Meeting of Congress in

to Counteract the Attempts of the Enemy. I however hope that your 
Letters, should they fall into their hands will not afford them much 
Comfort, nor give them any great Prospects of advantages, tho' I shall 
be unhappy until I know the Contents, and Beg by the Return of this

Philadelphia, Oct 29. 1776. 

Honoured Sir, 

By my worthy Colleague Mr Penn, I do myself the honour to transmit 
a resolution of the Continental Congress which bears immediate relation 
to the State of North Carolina.^ The Congress having been informed 
that the Armed vessels belonging to the Enemy have lately quitted the 
River of Cape fear, and have proceeded to the Northward, have bestowed 
their thoughts upon the practicability of fortifying that entrance into your 
state, and excluding the British Men of War. The importance of such 
a measure must weigh as powerfully with you as with them, and I am well 
assured that nothing will be wanting on your part to carry it into Execu- 
tion with all possible dispatch 

You will observe that this is to be executed at the Expence of your 
own particular state ; a recommendation of a similar kind went to South 
Carolina, in consequence of which they have erected very great and very 
expensive fortifications at their own cost.^ It becomes Oeconomy in you 
to bear this Expence yourself, rather than by making it Continental, 
expose yourself to pay your proportion of the large fortifications which

Sir 

.... It gave me much Concern that you had not an immediate and 
fully satisfying answer to your Letter to Congress relating to the dissolv- 
ing the Court Martial. There was a full and ample report brought in 
upon it by the board of War but it was postponed after some Debate for 
a little and many things being thrust in that seemed to require immediate 
Despatch it w^as some time before it was brought in again and the second 
time wdien it was just about to be almost unanimously agreed to by the 
artful Management of some who wanted a little Alteration made it was 
postponed again by the Demand of a paper which was not at hand and 
since that time your friends thought it not w^orth while to resume it.^ 
I must however assure you that by far the greatest part of the Congress 
have a very high sense of your importance and services in a particular 
Manner for discouraging to the utmost of your power Colonial Jealousies 
and Distinctions. 

I have written to General Maxwell that he is indebted to you for a very 
honourable Mention of him in your Letter to Congress which was read 
at the last promotion of General Officers when he could certainly have 
been promoted but for some of his friends here.^ ....

Philadelphia, November ist, 1776. 
Sir, 

I take the freedom thro' you to communicate to the Honourable the 
Convention the memorial of several of the prisoners from North Carolina 
now confined in the Gaol of this City. Their confinement tho' accom- 
panied with every circumstance of humanity which the publick security 
will admit of must however as the Winter advances become more irksome, 
from a scarcity of cloathing an inconvenience which at this time it will 
be very difficult to relieve. I shall not take the freedom to intrude my 
opinion upon the Conventions. I may be permitted to say that I lament 
that conduct which has drawn upon them the resentment of their injured 
Country. I feel sincerely for their distressed families, and earnestly wish 
they may be restored to their homes as soon as such a measure can take 
place without hazarding the safety of North Carolina."

On the same day (presumably; the date is merely "Friday") Rush addressed the 
following note to the president of the Pennsylvania council of Safety (copied from

The enclosed petition was referred to the council of Safety by the Congress. He is 
entitled I believe to half pay from our State agreeable to some late resolutions of 
congress." 

The petition referred to is probably that of Ezekiel Letts, in Pa. Arch., first ser., V._57, 
to which Rush has appended an endorsement, dated Oct. 31, 1776. There is no mention 
of the case in the Journals. The resolutions referred to are of Aug. 26.

its full Complement, have passed the enclosed Resolves, authorizing you 
to grant Warrants to such Officers as you shall think proper, provided 
there are no Commissioners from the State to which such Officers belong.^ 

As it is of the greatest Consequence that the Militia now in Service 
should not leave the Camp at this Crisis, it is the Desire of Congress that 
you will take such Steps as you shall judge best for attaining this End ; 
and that in particular, you should for that Purpose write to such of the 
States as have any Militia in the Government of New York, requesting 
their Assistance in the Business. 

The Commissions for such Officers as you shall please to appoint by 
Warrant, in Consequence of the enclosed Resolves, shall be forwarded 
as soon as possible. 

The Resolves herewith transmitted, I am to inform you, do not extend 
to the Maryland troops, as the Commissioners from that State are on 
their Way to Head Quarters to appoint Officers agreeably to the former 
Resolves of Congress. You will therefore be pleased to suspend any 
appointment of Officers for that State, until you shall hear further from 
Congress, or until the Arrival of those Gentlemen shall make it un- 
necessary.'

' Some resolutions of the Maryland convention relative to raising the state's 
quota of troops were presented to Congress Oct. 23 and referred to a committee. 
The committee made its report Oct. 30, and the conclusions of Congress thereon were 
transmitted to the convention by President Hancock Nov. 4 (Force, Am. Arch., fifth 
ser., III. 508). For the origin and purpose of the Maryland commission, see the pro- 
ceedings of the Maryland convention, Oct. 4, 9, in the Journal of the Maryland Conven- 
tion, pp. 265, 272-274; Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.. III. 116, 120. The commissioners 
were Benjamin Rumsey. James Lloyd Chamberlaine, Thomas Contee, and John Han- 
son, jr. A letter from Rumsey to James Tilghman, Oct. 24 (Md. Hist. Soc, Red Book, 
IV. 44: Arch, of Md., XII. 397), throws light on the earlier proceedings of Congress on 
the matter. The letter is addressed : " To The Honble James Tilghman Esquire In 
his absence To any other of the Council of Safety of the Province of Maryland " : 

" I arrived here on Saturday Evening last but mj- Colleagues did not all arrive before 
last Monday. On Tuesday we laid the Resolves of Convention before the Congress and 
on Wednesday about one OClock two of their Members informed Us that the Mode 
proposed by our Convention of substituting the Gift of ten Dollars in Lieu of the hun- 
dred Acres of Land would prove in the Opinion of Congress extremely prejudicial to 
the united States as it would subject them all to the same Advance, an Expence in 
their Apprehension too great to be borne and wch. to use their own Expressions would 
break the Back of all North America they represented that Land might be bought for 
three Dollars per hundred that the Soldiery had already extorted from the State greater 
Wages than could well be borne. They further requested to know if We would proceed 
to attempt the Inlistment of the Men with the twenty Dollars Bounty without promising 
the ten Dollars which Congress were not inclinable to grant at present but had appointed 
a Committee to draw up a Letter to the Convention of Maryld on the Subject of their 
Resolves setting forth their Reasons for not furnishing Us with Money and dissuading 
them from that Mode of raising Men. 

" We informed the Gentlemen our Province had no Land solely, that an Expectation 
was formed by the People of our State that what was conquered from an Enemy at 
the joint Expence of Blood and Treasure of the whole should become their joint property 
but as Qaims had been set up opposite to our Ideas of natural Justice it became a 
wise people rather to prepare for the worst by giving ten Dollars now than trust to the 
mercy of a few Venders from whom they would be obliged to purchase (having 
pledged their Honour) at any price, the Case of all Monopolies ; that we had limited 
Orders from our Convention a special Authority under which We must act and not 
deviate ; that if their Letter to our Convention could be wrote in any reasonable Time 
we would await the Event and return or advance as we should be by them ordered.

Philadelphia, November 6th, 1776. 
Dear Sir, 

You will not wonder that I should be obliged to answer your favor of 
the 5th instant in a great hurry, after detaining the bearer some time 
before I could even sit down to write. 

It seems there is some foundation for the report you heard, although 
not strictly true. I was not in Congress when Dr. Rush brought the 
account from the Council of Safety, but am told, he moved for some 
Continental troops being ordered down, which was opposed by several 
members upon the very principles you would wish, and finally the motion 
was rejected ; but as a Virginia regiment was ordered up from the Eastern 
Shore, they were directed to halt at Dover for the further orders of 
Congress, on the supposition that your government would apply for them 
if they should think it necessary.^ 

This I believe to be the true state of facts, and as my sentiments are 
totally with you, I am ready to obey your commands, or do anything you 
desire, if in my power; being very sincerely, dear sir, your obedient 
servant, 

Robert Morris. 

Resolves from the united States, that the Resolves ran in the Stile of We would not. 
We remarked in Reply that the Terms made use of were ought not and the two Reasons 
that appeared in the Resolves themselves were first that the Mode of Calculation was 
unequal and the second that it was not of our power to comply not having the Lands 
solely and exclusively and yet notwithstanding Injustice was done Us and We had not 
the Lands etc We had as a State resolved to raise the Men requested by Congress which 
together with our former Zeal in the Cause evinced our Attachment to it and ought in 
our Opinion to have excused us from such an Imputation. Thus ended the Discourse and

Body of men marched to Canada after the fall of G Montgomery and that 
lie has never been able to obtain any Pay by reason that Gen. Schuyler 
forbid it. he knows not why and the Men greatly disaffected and preju- 
diced agst the Service, and praying to be allowed their W^ages etc. (I 
suppose in the same situation w'' Col Warner)* much Dispute was about 
it and finally all that c** be obtained was to refer it to the Comisrs. of 
AccÂ°* at Albany to examine and make Rei)ort. it was suggested the 
probable reason was. His men went into Inoculation contrary to order 
etc. and that was alledged as a sufficient Reason to cut them off etc.. and 
that Crime if one in the Circumstances, was treated with impolitic Sever- 
ity I think to say no more. I am greatly concerned that it will have a 
very ill Effect and disaffect Men to the Northern Service, the distressing 
feelings of the Men under the certain prospect of taking and dying with 
that Disease etc. in my opinion pleads strongly in their Excuse, and in 
such Cases allowances ought to be made and Faults winked at, especially 
when the Men are so much wanted etc. things appear in a very different 
light to me than to some here etc.

Philadelphia, Nov. 6, 1776.^ 
My dear Sir, 

.... Congress could not account for the Delay of the Assemblies to 
send Committees to the Camp agreeable to their Recommendation, but 
by your Letter I am led to believe that the answer of our Assembly was 
among those Letters which were lately stolen from an Express on the 
Road. The Necessity of immediate Application to the important Business 
of inlisting a new Army indued Congress to direct the Commander in 
Chief to give orders for that Purpose even though the Committees should 
not have arrivd.^ .... 

Nov. pth. Mr. Partridge * arrivd in this City the last Evening, having 
been dispatched by your Committee at Genl. Washington's Head Quarters, 
who have consulted with the General concerning the Augmentation made 
by our Assembly of the Pay of the Troops to be raisd by our State. The 
General advisd them to lay the Matter before Congress. We intend to 
bring it on this day. I have strong Doubts whether it will succeed here. 
Men must be prevaild upon to inlist at some Rate or other, and I think 
it must be confessd that our State have shewn a laudable Zeal for the 
publick Service. But if the other States which are to have Troops in the 
Army should not consent to give the same Encouragement, it may cause 
great Uneasiness among them. I am the more ready to believe it will not 
be well receivd in Congress because a proposal made not long ago by the 
Maryland Convention for them to offer to their Men Ten Dollars in Lieu 
of the 100 Acres of Land was rejected.^ 

Nov. II. On Saturday last Congress considerd the Business on which 
Mr, Partridge is here. A Com*^ was appointed who have this day 
reported against your Resolution and the Report is agreed to, but as the 
Resolution must be known to the Soldiers, it has greatly embarrassd us. 
A Motion was made to limit the Duration of the Inlistments, which after 
Debate was postpond and is to be determind tomorrow. If the present 
Encouragement offerd by Congress is continued only for a limited Time 
of three or four years, it certainly would be very great. I will inform 
you further of this Affair tomorrow.

sidered and Congress have resolvd upon an Alternative; that is, so far 
to reconsider their former Resolution as to admit of Inlistments for

195. Edward Rutledge to Philip Schuyler/ 

November 6th: 1776 
Dear Sir 

The Part which I have taken in Congress relative to your Character 
and Conduct, has I trust, been such as the Measures which you have 
adopted, and the Principles by which they were directed will fully justify." 
That you have sustain'd for a length of Time an uncommon Load of 
Calumny is alas ! too true ; but tho' your Friends were much mortified to 
find that they were unable effectually to oppose the Torrent, yet they felt 
some Consolation in reflecting that the Day would come when you would 
appear in your true Character; I mean in the Character of a firm and 
disinterested Patriot. I congratulate you upon the Prospect of its Ap- 
proach, and wish that I could hold my Seat in Congress until I could see 
you in Philadelphia, and contribute my Assistance to do Justice to your 
Reputation : But a Desire of returning to my native Home from which 
I have been absent for more than Eighteen Months will deprive me of that 
Satisfaction. You however will suffer nothing from my Absence, as I am 
convinced you will receive ample Justice from those whose Duty it is to 
administer it

My dear Sir: 

.... I have just received your favour of the 21st ultimo. Your 
giving up to Captain Plance his small adventure is, in my opinion, very 
right; but by some hints that have been dropped, am inclined to think 
that some gentlemen suppose you have exceeded your power. Captain 
Bowden, I find, has preferred a petition, which is referred to a committee. 
I have a letter from Colonel Wentworth on the subject, which I shall 
answer in a day or two. I heartily wish there may be some method 
adopted whereby that gentleman may be relieved, but must confess am

plains much of the Roads and I believe justly, he was Inoculated Yester-

departure, some private Letters from Genl Lee of Yesterdays date are 
very incouraging. If you pass'd through the Army, you must be sensible 
of the want of Cloathing and as you know what was done in Congress 
respecting that matter no doubt You'll use your influence to draw the 
attention of the Executive Power of Our state to that Subject. I find 
the Genl. Court of the Massachusetts have increas'd the pay of their 
Soldiers and have sent a Committee to Camp to inlist the men, but Genl. 
Washington wo*^ not consent to their giving out Orders till the matter 
was lay'd before Congress one of the Gentn.* arriv'd Yesterday what 
will be done in the affair I know not. we really have a Choice of Diffi-

advantages of those difficulties The Massachu*^. have increas'd the pay 
of their Soldiers to 10 dols. pr Month for the new army if that sho'^ be 
come into, the charge of the Army will be so great that it will discourage 
many and undoubtedly will cause some heart burnings in a certain 
Assembly; on the other hand, if the matter has taken air among the 
Soldiers and sho*^ not be agree'd to there is greater danger that we shall 
have no Army this affair is referr'd to a Committee who I suppose will

Honourable Gentlemen: 

General Scluiyler is very desirous of having- an answer to his Letters 
respecting^ the Nanticoke Inthans. The Six Nations repeatedly complain 
that those of that Nation who were left in Maryland are detained there 
contrary to their Inclinations. This idea, tho' not founded in Truth 
creates much uneasiness, and is constantly held up by the Indians in their 
conferences with the General. Congress have before written to your 
State on the Subject on which I have now the honour of addressing- you 
by order of the Board of War, but have not been favoured with an 
Answer, which I have it in command to request you will now be pleased 
to give that it may be transmitted to General Schuyler, and he may thereby 
be enabled to satisfy the minds of the Indians on this subject.^ 

With the greatest respect I have the Honour to be your most obedt 
hble Servt

mittees all the Evening. In a word I am fatigued almost to death. 
9 Colonies you know are required to compose a Congress. Neither 
Georgia Maryland Delaware or New York have been for some time past 
represented so that your humble Servant is compelled to a constant un- 
remitting attendance. I never in my life felt myself so perfectly excul- 
pated from the Sin of Omission. I am at a loss to conceive how I have 
found time to write so many publick and private letters, amongst the 
latter before this you are convinced that I have not been unmindful of 
you 

From the many difficulties which attend the raising an Army here and 
to the Eastward I cannot too earnestly press upon you the necessity of 
forwarding by every possible method the recruiting Service, the Bounty 
and pay are both enormous and I hope will secure us success in recruiting 
to the Southd. tho the Eastern Gentry are not yet satisfied, and wish to 
screw us up a few pegs higher,' but they will be disappointed for in my 
opinion matters are now come to this. Give way to the extortion of the 
Army and you part with the property of the Continent to them and become 
Slaves to their Avarice and Caprice. Disband your Army and you are 
Slaves to a British Tyrant. Your Slavery dififers only in the name of the 
Superiour. if I am a Slave let me have one rather than 60,000 Masters. 
However these Gentry will soon I hope be brought to reason and we shall 
have a formidable force on reasonable Terms 

Pray request the Convention to write me fully of what they wish to 
have accomplished here within the compass of my abilities, and not leave 
me to guess at a meaning. If it can be prevented I wish you could avoid 
a demand for a large sum on the Contl. Treasury for a while at least. It 
runs a little low just now but will soon I hope by Lottery and Loan Office 
both of which are established by Congress will be up again. As to settling 
the publick Accounts Gentlemen in Carolina are employed to adjust those 
in Virginia so vice versa. Adieu I am at the bottom of my Sheet Love

3 Two letters from the Maryland commissioners are appropriate here. One of 
them, dated at Philadelphia, Nov. 13, is from Benjamin Rumsey and is addressed to 
Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer. The pertinent part is as follows : 

" Congress have this day given an Answer to the Resolutions of our State which being 
an intire new One We have dispatched to the proper place to be considered they resolve 
that the Troops may be inlisted for three Years and a Bounty of twenty Dollars only 
be given or during the War and One hundred Acres of Land be added to the Bounty 
they will not specify where the Land lies belonging to the united States. 

" Our Instructions run that they are to be inlisted during the War of Course when 
our State accedes to it we can proceed. Congress has got rid of the Difficulty with 
Respect to the Land and has not closed in with either of the Propositions made by our 
State nor receded intirely from their own Resolution. 

" But if they have escaped they embarrass Us. What can We do with our Regulars? 
they are inlisted during the War : Must we inlist them again in the Service of the State 
for three Years? I imagine our State will not incline to do so if they do we ought to 
have Instructions on that Head." (Md. Hist. Soc, Red Book, IV. 46; Arch, of 
Md.. XII. 442; Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser., III. 660.) 

The other letter, dated Nov. 14, is signed by James Lloyd Chamberlaine, Thomas 
Contee, Benjamin Rumsey, and John Hanson, jr., and is addressed to "The Honorable 
Mathew Tilghman Esqr., President of the Convention of Maryland " : 

" On receipt of yours of the 10 Instant We waited on the Honorable Congress. This 
morning received a Letter and Resolutions of Congress, the inclosed are Copies. To us 
new difficulties arise, among others a grand one, Whether, our Regular Troops, (who 
are already engaged during the war) shoud now be inlisted for three years. As we 
conceive the subject matter of those Resolves to be new, we wait for further directions 
from the honourable Convention of our State. As time grows Short we have sent off 
the express with the utmost despatch." (Md. Hist. Soc, Red Book, IV. 49, in the writing 
of Rumsey; Arch, of Md., XII. 452; Force, Am. Arch., fifth sen, III. 673.) The reply

Case the Enemy should intend here. The ships come out slowly but 
100 were seen two of them large yesterday afternoon when the Express 
left Long branch. It is the opinion of intelligent Persons that you should 
immediately send a Body of Militia to the fort at Willingsport on Dela- 
ware lest they should send a detachment against it. As soon as further 
Intelligence comes the Assembly shall be made acquainted with it and I 
doubt not the most vigorous Exertions will be made as most here seem 
to think the Design is against this important Place.'

Gentlemen, 

Since dispatching^ the Express yesterday * with IntelHgence that a Fleet 
of above and [sic'] Hundred Vessels had left New York, the Congress have 
received a Letter from General Green containing- further Accounts; a 
Copy of which, in Obedience to their Commands, I now enclose.' 

It appears from this Information, that Lord Dunmore is to take the 
Command of a Fleet bound for the Southward, and said to be for South 
Carolina. But as it is by no Means certain against which of the Southern 
States, the Expedition is designed, it is highly necessary you should be on 
your Guard. I shall not detain the Express, only to add that you will 
make such Use of this Intelligence, as the Importance of it requires. 

I have the Honour to be, Gentlemen, 

Your most Obedt and Very Hble Servt 

John Hancock, Presidt. 

[P. S.] Since the foregoing, Congress have pass'd a Resolve, respect^' 
the Troops in your State, and the necessity of the Exertion of a part of 
your Militia, which I inclose you and to which I beg Leave to Refer you 
as also to the Resolve respect^ the Inlistments. 

Please to forward the Dispatches to South Carolina by a fresh Express.

Since my last Nothing material has occurred here, nor have I any 
Thing in Charge from Congress, except to request you will negotiate an 
Exchange of the Hessian Prisoners at Elizabeth Town under the Care of 
Mr. Ludwick as soon as possible. They have been treated in such a 
Manner during their Stay in this City, that it is apprehended, their 
going back among their Countrymen, will be attended with some good 
Consequences.^

PHiLADELriiiA November i6 1776. 
Sir 

When I closed my letters last eveninj^.* I did not imag-ine that it would 
be necessary for me to write anything- furtlier upon the motives which 
induced the Congress to send the Express who is the bearer of this. The 
Representation of the delegates of South Carolina, stating the weakness of 
that colony and its incompetency to its own defence, if attacked by a 
formidable force of the Enemy, its reliance upon North Carolina for that 
succour which it had little reason to expect from any other source, their 
Apprehensions that an attack was immediately intended by General Howe 
upon Charlestown, have induced Congress to pass a resolve which this 
incloses, and have detained the express to give an opportunity to com- 
municate it to your honourable body.' .... 

The Continental Congress have therefore thought proper to recommend 
that the Continental Troops under Genl Moore should be stationed where 
they may be in a capacity to be suddenly and most effectually useful to 
South Carolina, and at the same time not at such a distance from ourselves 
as to be incapable of rendering No. Carolina Assistance in case the Enemy 
should be infatuated enough to attenpt to penetrate it. This measure 
recommended by Congress will I doubt not obtain your approbation, yet 
as the full and perfect security of North Carolina is a first and important 
object to me the representative of it, I did not think myself at liberty to 
consent to any arrangement which might weaken our internal resources 
without a competent substitute in lieu of them. This induced my applica- 
tion that the Militia which we might have occasion to call forth should 
be at the Continental Expence which from the justice of it obtained their 
assent 

Inclosed you have another Resolve which the necessity of recruiting 
an army immediately to the Eastward has rendered proper. Congress, 
tho well convinced of the utility of enlisting men during the War, as it 
would tend to prevent the frequent calls for bounty upon new enlistments, 
and obviate the difficulties which result from troops leaving Camp when 
their services are most essential, and when perhaps the fate of America 
might depend upon their stay, that we might have an army enured to 
serv^ice and discipline, thought proper to direct them to be raised during

been ofifered by some of the New-England States, and the additional 
Bounty which hath been offered in One of them. This Measure is con- 
demned by many Members of Congress, and by our General. It will they 
say necessitate the other States to do the same, which will greatly enhance 
the Continental Debt and Expense ; or we must have an Army doing the 
same Services for different Rewards which would occasion Jealousies, 
Envyings and Discord among the Soldiers to the great Injury of the 
public Service, As We have only offered an Additional Bounty We are 
less culpable in the Estimation of those who condemn the Deviation from 
the Original Resolve than any of the Transgressors. It is now in the 
Option of Soldiers to inlist for Three years without the Grant of Land, 
or during the War with it. This Alternative, with the retiring of the 
Enemy will I hope answer the Purpose.^

saw the Fleet bear away, after he had wrote, and sail Eastward until 
they sunk below his Horizon. That they were headed by Two Frigates, 
and their Rear was guarded by a large Ship.* ....

.... A committee from the Massachusetts Gen'l Court arrived at

Gen'l Court had raised the pay of their soldiers 20/ per month, the 
General choose the matter should be laved before Congress before they 
proceeded to business, accordingly one of committee ^ came here, this 
affair has perplexed Congress exceedingly, all the Southern States think 
the incouragement to the Soldiers much too great before and if this com- 
mittee are permitted to follow their instructions the pay of the whole army 
must be raised. This by no means could be consented to. Congress have 
therefore revoked their Resolution for Inlisting the army during the war, 
and recommend the inlistment for three years only, as you'll see by the 
Resolution transmitted by the President. I Heartily wish this may have 
the desired effect. I really think they (the Massachusetts) were very 
wrong in raising the monthly pay. if they supposed the encouragement 
given by Congress insufficient, why could they not have increased the 
Bounty, or have pursued some measure, that would not have effected the 
whole army ? This affair has caus'd more perplexity and uneasiness than 
any thing that has happened in my time.* ....

Philadelp*, 18. Nov. 1776 
Sir, 

The establishing the New Army is a Subject of the most interesting 
Nature, and I fear will be attended with much Dihculty. notwithstanding 
all the Encouragment offerd the Men for inlisting, the Service the People 
have been called to has been hard. They have suffered much for the 
Want of Many Things, and have been too much exposed to the Oppres- 
sions of Harpys who for Triffles have stript them of their Wages. These 
Evils I hope in future will in a good Measure be remedied, as the men 
are to be cloathed," and it is now the Deliberation of Congress how they 
shall be regularly and in the cheapest Manner supplyed in the suttling 
Way.^ and I hope also the Medical Department will undergo a Reform 
of ]\[en at least, if not of Measures, that not so much Complaint which I 
fear has been too well grounded, may be heard respecting the Conduct 
of that Department,* but after all that can be done I still fear that the 
int[er]esting Business will go on slowly, and sorry I am that the late 
Encouragment for that purpose was not earlier made. Congress appre- 
hend this matter may become more embarrassed by what the Massa- 
chusetts have done in raising the pay, and w^hich I now understand has 
been adopted by Connecticut, it is the opinion of Gentlemen here, and so 
of Genl. Washington and of all the other Genl. Officers, that no Army can 
subsist together under different continental pay. and also if the Massachu- 
setts Plan had been adopted by Congress (and which would enhanch an 
Expence which it is tho't we are not well able to bear) they could not be 
certain that any other plan would take Effect, if particular States might 
at their pleasure offer Troops other pay. in a Word they say that such 
Conduct must immediately Subvert any continental Regulation for this

One of the Gentlemen of Massachusetts, appointed to assist in providing 
their Quota, was sent by Genl. Washington here before he entered on the 
Business of his appointment. You will perceive that the Measure 
adopted by Massachusetts has been reprobated by Congress, the Gentle- 
man has gone back with this Errand to Genl. Washington where I under- 
stand the Gentlemen from Connecticut are upon this Business. I think 
it is Very unhappy that the Massachusetts took this step, without advice. 
R Island' I understand has offered their Men a large additional Bounty 
which may be much less Mischeivous, as it is but a temporary business, and 
Wheither Connecticut will not be finally oblidged to take some such step 
I cannot say, tho' I know many Gentlemen here and I believe a considerable 
Majority will equally reprobate this Measure as the Other, and if it is 
done it must be certainly at the Colony's expence. Such a thing has been 
mentioned in Congress, but it gave many Gentlemen much Offence, as they 
Said that every Other State must be oblidged to do the like. I mention 
these Difficulties hoping that the Wisdom of the Colony will be able to 
obviate them, tho' to me they are too perplexing to point out any particular 
Way in which it can be done, but it is certain We must have an Army other- 
wise We shall be reduced to the most Unhappy Condition.^ A Lottery is 
agreed upon by Congress, that with the Loan Office may Effect something 
considerable to reduce the Currency, but yet I think something more ex- 
tensive must Very shortly be adopted to establish the Finances.^ you will

used (see the text in Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser., III. 776). The second paragraph refers 
to the resolution of the same date in regard to recruiting, which applied to all the states. 
It would seem that the further resolution in regard to recruiting, passed Nov. 21, was 
also included (see ibid., p. 777).

Gentlemen. 

.... I have seen your opinion to our Commissioners that they should 
proceed and inlist our Troops for three years.^ I am apprehensive you 
do not see the opinion and object of Congress in its fullest Extent. The 
Congress will agree that Maryland may raise her Troops for three years, 
but have declared, and now hold, our State bound to contribute her pro- 
portion of the Expense attending the procuring of lands for the officers 
and soldiers furnished by other States for the war. We have proposed 
and urged on Congress that the question as to the procuring Lands at the 
expense of the united States, and our claim that the back Lands acquired 
from the Crown of G. B. in the present war should be a common stock 
for the benefit of the united States, and should remain open for the 
determination of some future Congress. We have proposed that any 
State which may raise its Quota for the War and give a bounty in Lieu 
of Land sho*^. indemnify the united States from any Claim from their 
officers and Soldiers who received an allowance in Lieu of Land, and that 
such State should not be chargeable to the united States for any part of 
the Expense attending the procuring of Lands for the officers and Soldiers 
of the other States who shall furnish Troops for the War. Both these 
propositions have been rejected. This day a Resolve passed, that each 
State be at Liberty to inlist for the War or three Years.^ what our

Philad, Nov. 23rd. 1776 Saturday. 
Gentlemen 

.... The Congress have resolved to encrease their Navy. Two 
frigates of 36 Guns are to be built in our State. 

Many of tlie Congress, some true Friends, are uneasy at the Powers to 
tlie Delegates of Maryland, they are apprehensive, if made known they 
will reach Lord Howe, and encourage him, and if the Courts of Europe 
should see them, it would prevent a foreign alliance, some Reasons are 
given to countenance this Opinion. I do not .see why they should not be 
published in the Journall. the powers relate to Peace and War, and can 
be of no Service to the publick. I wish You would consider This Subject.'^ 

In eight Days the Enlistment of the far greater part of our*Army 
expires. I greatly doubt if we shall be able to prevail on the Troops to 
enter into the Service. I have some Hopes of obtaining our wish from 
Congress. Our Commissioners will proceed on tomorrow I believe, how- 
ever whether they do or not is a secret.^

Sir, 

We have continued in this Place untill this Day in wch. We shall set 
off for the Camp not being able to proceed before neither under the 
Letter nor Spirit of our Commission. 

Our Convention had certainly two capital Objects in View that as the 
Congress had engaged the Faith of the United States to furnish the 
Soldiery with the Bounty of Lands which they were to purchase, it fol- 
lowed by Implication that the United States had None belonging to them 
in Common but must purchase of particular States who claimed a 
Monopoly in them and of Course might ruin those States who had 
None. Her View then was to have these Lands declared a common 
Stock as being purchased (if ever purchased) by the joint Blood and 
Treasure of the Confederacy or find no Land to her Ruin. 

The first Satisfaction She received on this Head was that She might 
inlist for three Years and give the 20 Doll. Bounty, but must give the

Soldiers the Alternative to inlist during the War on the first Conditions, 
Opening two Rolls for the Purpose. 

This not pleasing they Resolve again that the Commissioners may 
proceed to inlist for three Years upon one Roll alone keeping it always 
in View that it was better to inlist during the War, if it did not retard 
the Service 

This Resolution keeping up the first Bone of Contention the Land and 
by Implication that the States had none still not answering expectation 
The Congress further resolved that any Resolutions that had passed 
should neither operate to weaken or strengthen the Claim of the United 
States or any of them to any Back Land by which this point that has given 
such uneasiness in our Province will be saved and be discussed hereafter 
in our future Confederacy. 

The Second point they had in View was the point of Taxation which 
they thought unequal being rated on Slaves as well as Whites. This 
has been expressly named as the Mode as to 6 Millions of Dollars. As 
to 14. more the same Declaration is made as in the Article of Land, that 
the proportion of sinking it shall be adjusted hereafter on each State and 
that nothing heretofore done shall strengthen or weaken such Enquiry 
or Question. 

Our Province having in some Measure obtained a Satisfaction on those 
two Heads Nothing now remains but to consider whether the Convention 
having impowered Us to proceed and inlist for and during the War on 
the 20. Dollars we can go on the Terms of three Years and the same 
Bounty being for a less Term and in this Point we are pretty generally 
agreed to depart from the Letter to preserve the Spirit.^ ....

the Virginia, upon the recommendation of Mr. Stone. 

The Congress have determined to build in Maryland two frigates of 
36 guns each, and I make no doubt but that one at least of these will be 
built at Baltimore. I suppose, when the committee meets on next Tuesday 
that directions concerning the building the new ships will issue to the 
respective States. Not a word has been yet said in Congress touching a 
quarrel with Portugal, nor will any such thing happen, I imagine, unless 
they should confiscate any of our Vessels.* ....

2 The favorable disposition of the court of France had for some time been 
known to the committee of secret correspondence (see, for instance, the committee's 
memorandum of Oct. i, no. 153, ante), but precisely when their information was dis- 
closed to Congress is not evident. Some such disclosure was made the latter part of 
August, probably through a letter of William Bingham, agent at Martinique (see nos. 97, 
136, ante). Doubtless even prior to this the committee had received the letters of Dumas 
and Arthur Lee, together with their correspondence with Beaumarchais, written in 
April, May, and June (see Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 85, 90, 95 et seq.). The first 
of Deane's letters of which the Journals make definite record is that of Oct. i (ibid., 
II. 153), which was read in Congress Dec. 21; but earlier letters, not only of Deane, 
but also of Dumas, Arthur Lee, and Beaumarchais, had been received by the com- 
mittee. It is not, however, apparent just when Deane's letter of Aug. 18 (ibid., II. 112) 
was received, but it was after Oct. i (see the committee to Deane, Oct. i, ibid., II. I57)-

". . . . I came into this town at eight o'clock Sunday evening, and waited on Mr. 
Hancock with your letter immediately after my arrival. Yesterday morning I was 
admitted to Congress, in general committee, and went as far in my relation of the 
wretched appointments of the Army, the dangerous and critical situation of the Jerseys 
and Pennsylvania, and the necessity of immediate vigorous exertions to oppose Mr. Howe, 
as their sensibility and my own delicacy would justify. After some debate, a requisition 
was made to the Assembly now sitting, and Council of Safety of Pennsylvania, of their 
whole Militia; and resolutions formed for the purpose of establishing wholesome and 
necessary regulations for this and the next campaign. 

" I received orders from Congress to remain in this town until your Excellency judged 
it necessary for me to join the Army. Those orders were in consequence of the divided 
and lethargic state of my countrymen, who appeared to be slumbering under the shade 
of peace, and in the full enjoyment of the sweets of commerce. 

" In the afternoon I waited on the Committee of Safety, and with much success 
addressed their passions. The Assembly are to meet this morning. Their lesson is 
prepared by the Committee of Safety and some of their leading members, who say 
matters will now go on well. 

" It is proposed to call on every man in the State to turn out. Such as refuse are to 
be fined five pounds per month, the fines to be distributed among those who inlist.

.... In this State it is proposed to call out all the Militia of four 
Countys and this city immediately for six weeks. Chester, Bucks, North- 
ampton and Philadelphia counties are the nearest to the Jerseys, and it 
is also proposed to call out a Company of volunteers from each Battalion 
in this State to enroll 'till loth March next. 

The preservation of this State and the Jerseys, and in great measure, 
the common Safety will depend on the success of this Requisition.' 

New Jersey is also called on for aid. and Delaware is solicited, and if 
our State could afford any assistance in time, an application would also 
be made to her.* 

If the present cloud should be happily dispersed, the new^ Levies will be

obtain honorable Terms of peace without an Army. The inlistment will 
be only for three years, on the bounty of 20 dollars, and the annual 
clothinsf. or the 20 dollars in lieu thereof, by the resolves of Congress.Â®

Monies which may be Wanted for the Nortliern Department will be sent 
upon Application of the Commissioners, perhaps the Ten Thousand" 
Dollars sent last summer may have answered the Necessary Expenditures. 
Last April I was directed by Congress to Conferr with Col Francis 
respecting some Indians then in this City.' I Waited upon him the first 
Time I had seen him the three pr[e]ceeding Months I had been here tho 
I Went every Day by his House, he was Very Complesant and said he 
knew I had iDeen Appointed to attend Congress but had never heard that 
I had been in the City, after the Business was over, I tho't it best to 
Mention to him the bringing the Susquehannah AfTair into the late 
Treaty * so that he might not be able to say that I had been with him, 
but had not Honor enough to say a Word to him upon the subject. I told 
him that he had douptless been informed, that an Enquiry had been made, 
how the Susquehannah Business had been introduced into the late Indian 
Conferance. he said he had never been informed of it. which to me after 
all my Acquaintance with this Gentleman was surprizing. I then told 
him the affair particularly, he became Very angry recriminated with 
great Severety upon the Commissioners upon Genl. Schyler in particular, 
called it an ex Parte Affair etc. I let him know that the Matter had been 
conducted with great Honor and Propriety, and that as I might be sus- 
pected of some Partiality as belonging to Connecticut, I had declined 
going into the Examination myself, but left the Matter to those whose 
Impartiality and Integrity could not be suspected. This was the Sub- 
stance of every Thing that passed between him and me at that Time. 
I did not imagine I had been guilty of any Disrespect to the Commis- 
sioners or had with Impropriety mentioned the affair. Nothing but a 
mere Point of Honor induced Me to say a Word to him upon the Subject. 
Sometime after he delivered an Open Letter to Me, the Copy of which 
I enclose. I felt much Chagrined at it, and told Francis that I never had 
blamed the Commissioners for what they had done and that I would now 
inform him, if he could be under any Misapprehension that in my Opinion 
if they had neglected an Enquiry they would have been guilty of a 
Criminal Omission and that I never Signified a Lisp to him more than 
that I did not take the Examination, but that I did most cordially approve 
of what they had done, and that he never had the least Reason from any 
Thing I ever said to him to doupt of it. This was the Substance of what* 
pasd. at this Time, sometime after he put a Memorial to Congress,^ 
setting forth as tho' I had been guilty of Maltreating him and the Com- 
missioners and moved for an Enquiry, which I most heartily seconded.

no objection against. Fulmer Â® and one of the Onondagas, who was with

Gentlemen: 

We received Mr. McKesson's letter, dated the 25th November. We 
have, according to your request, applied to Congress for leave to our 
State to raise another battalion, to be commanded by Colonel Dubois, 
which is agreed to, and a resolve to that purpose is enclosed for employ- 
ing five Aid-Majors at the expense of our State.^ .... The accounts 
of the officers of the five battalions is with you to settle. The Congress

A Committee of Congress was appointed the 25th Septr last to procure 
cloathing in all the States on this Continent for the use of our Army and 
we find they wrote to you on the loth Octr requesting the favour of you 
to employ proper persons to purchase what could be obtained in your 
State to this letter they have not received any answer and the Congress 
being very anxious and impatient to have this important business duely 
attended to and executed have directed us to send one or more trusty 
persons into the Eastern States to Collect what has been bought and to 
make such further purchases of suitable articles as they can accomplish.^

I wrote You the 26th Novr ^ touching several Matters mentioned in 
the Letters received from You before that Time, and am informed by 
General Mifflin that he forwarded two of my Letters. You will therein 
find my Sentiments relative to a Contract, and the present Improbability

Rice from the southern States, and that I have recommended your 
immediate Application in strong Terms for Liberty to import Flower. 
I find You place great Confidence in a certain Southern Friend.* had he 
Voted with Us in this Instance, It had prevented the Necessity of a second 
Application, but this he rarely omits to avoid. Mention is likewise made 
of the Fish purchased of You to import military Stores, that the Quality 
was greatly reduced by age, in so much that it must be sent to the West 
Indies instead of Europe as was first intended, and You was desired when

As Congress is now adjournd to Baltimore in Maryland, and the

are now here to provide for the Protection of the Places as well as from 
the Resultt of their own opinion have adjourned themselves, to Baltimore 
in Maryland, a Place about no miles from this City, as it was judged

.... The sudden departure of the Congress from this place seems 
to be a matter of much speculation and People who judge by events, think 
they have been too precipitate, be that as it may, many things are thrown 
into great confusion by it, and I find ample employment in applying 
remedies wherever I can. The unfinished business of the Marine and 
Secret Committees, I intended to confine mvself to. but I hear so manv 
complaints and see so much confusion from other quarters that I am 
obliged to advise in things not committed to me. Circumstanced as our 
affairs now are I conceive it better to take Liberty's and assume some 
powers than to let the general interest suffer 

I suppose Congress will not determine on a hasty return to this place 
nor do I think it adviseable, untill the Enemy are actually gone into 
Winter Quarters, for a severe Frost may in a few hours enable them to 
cross Delaware above the Falls, so that if they remain in that neighbour-

hood you would here be subject to perpetual alarms, at the same time if 
may be depended on, that great inconveniences will arise daily in every 
department during your absence, to remedy this as much as possible I 
think a Committee should be sent here with such powers as Congress may 
Judge proper, in order that they may regulate the business of the Con- 
tinent necessary to be done here.^ There is the greatest scene of confusion 
in the management of the Continental Horses, Wagons, and Expresses 
that ever was exhibited, it was bad enough before Congress departed 
but it is ten times worse now and Jacob Hiltziemer a very honest man 
will run mad soon if not properly assisted or relieved in this department.' 
in short the Committee you send should have full powers to do whatever 
may be necessary to put every department on a Systematic footing. Mr. 
Clymer, Mr. Walton and myself will bestir ourselves and advise or assist 
in such things as we think absolutely necessary untill you appoint a Com- 
mittee and as the Board of War did not leave any orders for their Secy 
we have desired him to stay and assist us until he receives Orders. We 
hope the Board will excuse us for taking this liberty as Mr. Peters will 
be usefull here.* The Committee must have the command of money to 
answer various purposes as the calls for it are loud, large and constant. 
Should the Enemy retire to Brunswick or New York it may and I believe 
will be best for Congress to return as soon as that is certain

bility but partly also as a member of certain committees. On Dec. 21, at his suggestion, 
Congress appointed him and George Clymer and George Walton a committee to execute 
the necessary business of Congress in Philadelphia. Besides the letters of Morris and 
of the committee printed below, see the letters to Hancock, Washington, and others, Dec. 
13-30, in Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.. III. 1198, 1213, 1239, 1254, 1330, 1331, 1370, 1427,

3 In a letter of Jan. 10, 1777 (Library of Congress, Pap. Cont. Cong., no. 133, 
folio 42), the committee in Philadelphia took up the subject of the continental stables 
more explicitly: 

". . . . We mentioned some time ago the waste and destruction that was going 
forward in the Continental Stables here. The more we enquire into that Matter the 
more ruinous we find it, and the business is now in such a state of Confusion that we 
hardly know how to remedy it. Our Opinion is that no such thing as a Continental 
Stable should ever have existed. Generall Mifflin when he proposed it and established 
it we well know mean't to save mony, but the experiment will prove destructive to the 
last degree. The Horses after being worked to the Bone, become neglected because it 
is nobodys business to take care of them, the Feed is stolen wasted and destroyed, 
because nobody can tell who is intitled to it, and who is not. every Officer in the 
service crams his Horses into the Public Stables and calls him Continental, every Team 
that is hired and ought to find their own feed, say they are Continental and demand 
it as a right from the Public. Mr. Hiltzheimer does all he can to prevent waste imposi- 
tion and abuses, but they threaten his life and to burn his stables 

"We sent him a Gaurd [sic] and they were as bad as the waggoners, enclosed you 
have a Copy of the return he has made and of his note to us. In short if the Present 
Campaign was closed we should think it would be best to sell all the Continental Horses 
and waggons shut up the stables and encourage private people to provide the public 
with them on hire by good prices, for then the Horses would be taken care of and the 
feed not be wasted, and these are new very material objects." This letter is endorsed: 
" Rec'd 14 Jany 1777." See also the Journals of that date, p. 37 n. Congress took action 
upon the matter Jan. 18.

Philadelphia, December i6th, 1776. 
Gentloncn: 

.... Voii have enclosed the letters from Mr. Bing^ham and Mr. 
Deane;* the latter complaining-, as I have lon.t^ expected he would, for 
want of advices and remittances. In short, if the Cong^re.ss mean to suc- 
ceed in this contest, they must pay ji^ood executive men to do their business 
as it oug-ht to be, and not lavish millions away by their own mismanage- 
ment. I say mismanaj^ement, because no man living can attend the daily 
deliberations of Congress and do executive parts of business at the same 
time. I do aver there will be more money lost, totally lost, in horses, 
wagfons. cattle, etc., etc. for want of sufficient number of proper persons to 
look after them, than would have paid all the salaries Payne ever did or 
ever will grumble at.^ Mr. Deane has had a hard situation. I foretold 
it long since; and unless you employ some man of talents to collect 
materials and keep the Commissioners abroad constantly informed of 
wiiat is passing here, you never will have that consequence, nor your 
agents that dignity, they ought to have.* 

I should be glad you would return me these letters, or copies of them, 
and I will reply from hence. They have been with me but a few minutes, 
and I will not keep the express any longer, as I expect you are hungry as 
hawks after news from France. I cannot keep a copy of this; but in 
haste remain,

Baltimore, December i8th, 1776. 

The movements of the enemy's army in the Jerseys, by which the 
neighborhood of Philadelphia had become the seat of war, determined 
Congress to adjourn from thence to this town, where publick business 
will be entered on the 20 instant, unless a sufficient number of members 
should be assembled to begin sooner. At this place the publick business 
can be conducted with more deliberation and undisturbed attention, than 
could be the case in a city subject to perpetual alarm, and that had 
necessarily been made a place of arms. The propriety of this measure 
was strongly enforced by the continental Generals Putnam and Mifflin, 
who commanded in Philadelphia, and who gave it as their opinion, that, 
although they did not consider the town as liable to fall into the enemy's

The Day before yesterday I arrivd in this Place which is One hundred 
Miles from Philadelphia. The Congress had resolvd to adjourn here 
when it should become absolutely necessary and not before. This sudden 
Removal may perhaps be wonderd at by some of my Friends, but was not 
without the advice of Generals Putnam and Mifflin, who were at Philadel- 
phia to take Measures for its Preservation from the Enemy. For my own 
part, I had been used to Alarms in my own Country, and did not see the 
Necessity of removing so soon, but I suppose I misjudgd because it was 
otherwise ruled. It must be confessed that deliberative Bodies should not 
sit in Places of Confusion. This was heightned by an unaccountable 
Backwardness in the People of the Jerseys and Pennsylvania to defend

2 This note is appended to a copy of the resolve of Dec. 9, relative to the militia 
of Cecil, Baltimore, Harford, and Frederick counties. Maryland. The note was probably 
written in consequence of a resolve of Dec. 20, which was afterward rescinded. That 
is, this note to the convention may have been despatched between the passage of the 
order for explaining the proceeding to the council and its rescinding. The resolve 
appears in the Journals erased, with the marginal notation, "Counter-ordered". On 
Dec. 15 the council wrote to the delegates of Maryland: 

" Gentn. In consequence of a verbal message from the President of Congress 
delivered to us by Colo. Ewing, we instantly gave the necessary orders to the Command- 
ing officers of Frederick Baltimore and Harford and Caecil Counties to call together 
the Militia of those Counties to be in readiness to march to the assistance of Philadelphia 
expecting that we should every moment receive orders from Congress, but no such 
order have yet come to hand." Further on in the same letter the council remon- 
strates : 

" We cannot help observing to you that applying to individuals who necessarily must 
apply to the Council of Safety from whom their power must be deputed before they 
can act is losing of time to say nothing of the want of respect to a Body of men with 
whom the Executive Powers of the State are entrusted." Arch, of Md., XII. 530. 

In a letter to Brigadier-General Chamberlaine, Dec. 14 {Arch, of Md., XII. 529), the 
council says : " Col. Ewing tells us that a requisition has passed Congress for the 
militia of Baltimore Harford, Frederick and Cecil, Counties to march, and that he was 
desired by the President of that honorable Body to give us notice thereof, we wish not 
to loose a moment's Time. As soon as we hear further Intelligence, we will write you

Honourable Gentlemen 

After expressing our hopes that this will find you all three safely fixed 
at Paris we proceed with pleasure to acknowledge the Receipt of Mr. 
Deane's Letter of the first of October. When we reflect on the Character 
and views of the Court of London it ceases to be a Wonder that the 
british Ambassador and all other british agents should employ every 
means that tended to prevent European Powers but France more especially 
from giving America aid in this War. Prospects of accommodation it is 
well known would effectually prevent foreign Interference and therefore 
without one serious Design of accommodating on any Principles but the 
absolute Submission of America the delusive Idea of Conciliation hath 
been industriously suggested on both sides the Water that under cover 
of this dividing and aid wath holding Prospect the vast british Force sent 
to America might have the fairest chance of succeeding. And this 
Policy hath in fact done considerable Injury to the united states as we 
shall presently shew by a just Detail of this campaign for it is not yet 
ended 

All views of Accommodation with great Britain but on Principles of 
Peace as independent states and in a Manner perfectly consistent with 
the Treaties our Commissioners may make with foreign states being 
totally at an End since the Declaration of Independence and the Embassy 
to the Court of France Congress have directed the raising of 94 Battalions 
of Infantry with some Cavalry. Thirteen Frigates from 24 to 36 Guns 
are already launched and fitting and two Ships of the Line with five more 
Frigates are ordered to be put on the Stocks. We hear the Levies are

qfoinp^ on well in the difFerent states. Until the New Army is collected 
the Militia must curb the luiemics Proeiress. The very considerable h'orce 
that g;Tcat IVitain has already in X. America the Possibility of recruiting 
it here within their own Quarters by force and fraud together added to 
the Reinforcements that may be sent from Europe and the Difficulty of 
finding Funds in the present depressed state of American Commerce all 
conspire to prove incontcstibly that if France desires to preclude the 
Possibility of North America being ever reunited with great Britain now 
is the favourable moment for establishing the Glory Strength and com- 
mercial Greatness of the former Kingdom by the Ruin of her ancient 
Rival. A decided part now taken by the Court of Versailles and a vigor- 
ous Engagement in the War in Union with North America would with 
Ease sacrifice the fleet and Army of great Britain at this time cheifly 
collected about New York. The inevitable consequence would be the 
quick Reduction of the british Islands in the west Indies already bared 
of Defence by the Removal of their Troops to this Continent. For Reasons 
herein assigned Gentlemen you will readily discern how all-important it 
is to the Security of American Independence that France should enter the 
\\^ar as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure 
from her the Line of Battle Ships you were desired in your Instructions 
to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present State of 
things might decide the Contest at one Stroke. 

.... As all affairs relative to the Conduct of Commerce and Re- 
mittance pass through another Department we beg leave to refer you to 
the Secret Committee and Mr Thomas Morris their agent in France for 
every Information on these Subjects. 

The Neighbourhood of Philadelphia having by the Enemies movements 
become the Seat of War it was judged proper that Congress should adjourn 
to this Town where the public Business may be attended to with the un- 
disturbed Deliberation that its Importance demands. The Congress was 
accordingly opened here on the 20th Inst. 

As it is more than probable that the Conference with Lord Howe on 
Staten Island may be misrepresented to the Injury of these States we do 
ourselves the pleasure to inclose you an authentickated Account of that 
whole Business which the Possibility of Doctor Franklins not arriving 
renders proper This Step was taken to unmask his Lordship and evince 
to the World that he did not possess powers w'hich for the purposes of 
Delusion and division it had been suggested he did. 

Mr Deanes Proposition of Loan is accepted by congress and they have 
desired two Millions Sterling to be obtained if possible. The Necessity of 
keeping up the Credit of our Paper Currency and the Variety of important 
uses that may be made of this Money have induced congress to go so far 
as 6 per cent but the Interest is heavy and it is hoped you may be able 
to do the Business on much easier Terms. The Resolves of congress on 
this Subject are inclosed and your earliest Attention to them is desired that 
we may know as soon as possible the Event of this Application. 

Another Resolve of congress inclosed will shew you that Congress ap- 
prove of armed Vessels being fitted out by you on continental Account pro-

Philadelphia, 21st December, 1776. 
Gentlemen, 

I am now the only member of Congress in this city, unless Mr Walton, 
of Georgia, and Mr Clymer, my colleague, still remain, which I am not 
sure of.^ .... 

In this perplexing situation of things,' the Congress were informed, 
this day week, that an advanced party of Hessians and Highlanders had 
taken possession of Burlington, that they were pushing for Cooper's 
Ferry, opposite the city, and it was thought had the means of crossing the 
river. There were no troops to oppose them; our whole force, both by 
land and water, was above ; it was therefore deemed unsafe for Congress 
to remain here, and absolutely necessary that they should be in a place of 
safety, where they could deliberate coolly and freely without interruption, 

2 See nos. 211, note 9, 223, ayite. The resolutions referred to are of Dec. 23. 
This shows that the letter was not completed prior to that date.

Letter from the Committee of Secret Corres[pondenc]e to the Commissioners in France 
which you'l please to Sign and send with the other Papers to those Gentn by the first 
opp'y with proper orders for their being Destroy'd rather than the Enemy should get 
them. I need not suggest to you the Prejudice it would be to us if they should fall into 
their Hands. Mr. Deane's Letter is also enclosed that you may answer the Mercantile 
parts of it, this would have been done sooner but you will see there were many Parts 

of it on which the advice of Congress was necessary, this occasioned the Delay

and last Saturday they adjourned to Baltimore, where they are now 
sitting.* .... 

I will not enter into any detail of our conduct in Congress, but you may 
depend on this, that so long as that respectable body persist in the attempt 
to execute, as well as to deliberate on their business, it never will be done 
as it ought, and this has been urged many and many a time, by myself 
and others, but some of them do not like to part with power, or to pay 
others for doing what they cannot do themselves." 

I have Mr. Deane's favor of the 30th of September,' to myself, now 
before me; the letter, by the same conveyance from Martinico, under 
cover of Mr. Bingham's, I sent down to the committee at Baltimore, and 
wrote them my mind on the justice of your complaints for want of 
intelligence. I had often told it to them before; you know well I was not 
put in that committee to carry on the correspondence, but to find out the 
conveyances; however, I have been obliged to write all the letters that 
have been \vritten for some time past ; but as Colonel Lee, Mr. Hooper, 
and the Rev. Dr. Witherspoon are now added to the committee, I shall 
excuse myself from that task, although I have thought it proper to give 
you a just state of our affairs at this time, because I do not suppose the 
committee will be got fairly together in Baltimore yet, and when they do, 
it is probable they may not be fond of laying things before you so fully 
as I have done. Some of us are of very sanguine complexions, and are 
too apt to flatter ourselves that things are not so bad as they appear to be, 
or that they will soon mend, etc. Now my notion is, that you, gentlemen 
Commissioners, should be fairly and fully informed of the true state of 
affairs, that you may make a proper use of that knowledge, keeping 
secret what ought to be so, and promulgating what should be known. 

.... My own affairs necessarily detained me here after the departure 
of Congress; and it is well I staid, as I am obliged to set many things 
right that would otherwise be in the greatest confusion. Indeed, I find 
my presence so very necessary, that I shall remain here until the enemy 
drive me away.

Dear Sir: 

I thank you for your letter of the T2th November, which I received a 
few days before the Congress left Philadelphia 

I perfectly agree with you as to the impropriety of our military system. 
The several States will forever be influenced by local attachments. I am 
convinced the nomination to office will, in many instances, be very injudi- 
cious. If we expect to succeed in the present war, we must change our 
mode of conduct. The business of the Congress must be placed in 
different hands. Distinct and precise departments ought to be established. 
A gentleman of the military must be of the Board of War." ....

Baltimore, 24th December, 1776. 
My dear Sir: 

My last from Philadelphia I think was a day or two before Congress 
adjourned from that place, which was the nth instant.^ They met here 
the 20th, and are now doing business with spirit. The near approach of 
the enemy to that city struck such a panick in all orders of people there, 
except Tories, (of which you know there are not a small number,) that 

the contagion seized the nerves of some members of C , which caused 

a removal to this place, which I assure you was much against my inclina- 
tion ; however, I hope it's all for the best.* .... 

I should be very happy if I could hear the levies for the new Army 
were completed in the Eastern States. I expect there will be a still further 
requisition. It is absolutely necessary that we should have a very 
formidable Army in the field immediately. I hope every friend of 
America in the several States will forward this business with every pos- 
sible exertion.* 

The accounts from France, which are down to October, are very 
favourable. I wish, for the consolation of my friends, I was at liberty 
to communicate them, but circumstances will not admit of it; but I can 
say thus much, in the words of a correspondent, " A general war in Europe 
seems unavoidable." ^ , . . .

Hono. Sir; 

The near Approach of the Enemy to Philadelphia, the slowness of the

Town, which is about no Miles Southwest from Philadelphia.^ By our 
last advices the Militia are joining our army in great numbers, from which 
we have great hopes that G. How and his army will soon be in our power, 
or Return to New York. The Congress have encourag[em]ent of Assist- 
ance by the Spring. Nothing will be wanting on their part, to Support 
independence. Defeat the Enemy, and Render the united States, Great 
Honorable and Happy. 

An inexcusable Neglect in the OfFrs, want of Fidility, Honour, and 
Humanity, in the Drs and averice in the Suttlers, has Slain ten Soldiers 
to the Enemies one, and will Soon prevent every man of Common Sense 
from putting his Life and Fortune in the Power of Such as Destroy both 
without pity or mercy. I have proiX)s'd to Congress, that every State in 
future Should Appoint one or more Suttlers, as they think proper for 
their own men to be Supplied by a Committee Appointed by said State 
with everything Necessary for sick and well men, at a price Stipulated by 
said State, the Suttlers and Committee to be paid by and accountable to 
said State, and A Superintendent, who shall have no other Business but to 
see that every Soldier Belonging to the State is properly Supplied and 
Supported, agreeable to their Circumstances, and that proper Stopages be 
made for what they Receive when they are Receiving their wages. 

The Congress approve of the method, but say it is the Business and 
Duty of each State to take Care of their own men and they Expect they 
will.'. . . .

If the army under Clinton should receive a mortal Wound from the 
brave New-Englanders it would in my Opinion bring the War to a speedy 
Close; whereas if this Opportunity, of the Division of the British Army, 
should be neglected or not improved, the War in all Probability will be 
protracted to a great Length, if not speedily issued in our Destruction, in 
the Destruction of all We hold dear ; For We have good Reason to think 
that a Reinforcement of Twenty thousand Men will be sent over next 
Spring. By a Letter from an unknown, but I suppose a good Hand, read 
in Congress this Day, it appears that the Court of London had attempted 
and were attempting by every Means they could devise to procure Aid 
from every Power in Europe, or to induce them to a Neutrality ; and the 
Writer of the Letter gave it as his Opinion that w hat they could collect in 
Germany, together with Recruits raised in England, Scotland and Ireland, 
would amount to about that Number, and that Russia would not furnish 
them with any Men.^ From hence the Necessity appears that We should 
act in every Quarter this winter with the Spirit of Men contending for 
an invaluable Prize

because it was ruled otherwise, not indeed until the Opinions of Putnam

264. 1''kancis Lewis to Robert Morris.* 

Baltimore 26. Deccnir. 1776 
Dear Sir 

The Congress think it absokitcly necessary that a Number of Brass 
Field Pieces should be cast as soon as possible and have directed the 
Ordinance Board to request that you would direct an enquiry to be made 
for such persons as arc capable of conducting: that Branch. 

Mr. Paine informed Cong^ress that Mr Byers (who cast the Brass 
Cannon at New York) was then daily expected with his family at Phila 
and where there is an Air Furnace at which he mip^ht be employed ; Con- 
gress is therefore anxious to know if Byers is at Phila and can be there 
employed, or if any other person can be found capable of conductin*:^ that 
work. It is necessary also to inform you that at Christeen â–  I saw a quan- 
tity of Sea Coal, with some Copper, the latter said to be sent from New 
York. The Board of Ordinance imagine a Work of this kind may be 
erected in the Vicinity of this place, it being more convenient in getting 
supply of Sea Coal from Virginia, provided the Mettle can be procured 
with a proper person to conduct the Work, the latter is not to be obtained 
here; And as Congress has this Affair much at hart, they intreat you to 
make the strictest inquiry you can and inform them. 

Congress has this moment received letters from the General recom- 
mending in the most pressing terms the necessity of having a Number of 
Brass and Iron Cannon provided as early as possible for the next Cam- 
paigne on which he seems to say the fate of America in a great measure 
depends, he also strongly recommends an Augmentation of the Conti- 
nental Battallions to no â€” with five Battallions of Artillary ^ â€” Thus far 
from the Ordinance Board.* ....

3 In a letter to Congress, Dec. 5, Washington had pointed out the futility of rely- 
ing upon militia, and the urgent need of a larger standing army. Dec. 16 he returned to 
the subject with added emphasis. Dec. 20 he declared that, in consequence of the 
expiration of enlistments, ten days more would put an end to the existence of the army, 
suggested increasing the number of battalions to no, and also urged the augmentation of 
the artillery. On Dec. 24 he asserted that, unless there were re-enlistments, of which 
he was not hopeful, the army would be reduced to not exceeding 1500 effective men. 
Dec. 31 he wrote to Robert Morris : " To-morrow the Continental troops are all at 
liberty. I . . . . have promised them a bounty of ten dollars, if they will continue for 
one month. But here again a new difficulty presents itself : We have not money to 
pay the bounty, and we have exhausted our credit by such frequent promises, that it has 
not the weight we could wish. If it be possible, sir, to give us assistance, do it. Borrow 
money where it can be done. We are doing it upon our private credit. Every man of 
interest, every lover of his country, must strain his credit upon such an occasion. No 
time, my dear sir, is to be lost." The letter of Dec. 5 (read in Congress Dec. 6), those 
of Dec. 16 and 20 (read in Congress Dec. 26), and the letter to Morris are in Writings 
(ed. Ford), V. 66, loi, 112, 145 n., and in Force, Am. Arch., fifth sen. III., 1082, 1242,

Congress. Some of Washington's letters on the subject were intercepted by the British 
(see Robert Morris to the commissioners at Paris, Dec. 21, ibid., III. 1332, and Wharton,

obstinately persist in being discharged from your Service on New Years

assist in getting the Frigates out. when they come we will make the 
best bargain we can with them and if nothing else will do, we will engage 
to send them home in one or two of those ships. If they come on these 
terins we think Capt Read and his officers shou'd come with them that we 
may if possible get away the Washington, as well as the Delaivare. Con-

proper and necessary in this place. ^ We wrote Genl Washington of our 
appointment and proposed that he should forward his dispatches to Con- 
gress through our hands unless when they might be of such a Nature as 
he wou'd not choose any person shou'd see them before Congress, he 
approves this plan as it will ease his Correspondence with us and at the 
same time we shall receive information that will be necessary for our 
government in many affairs that will most probably come under our 
consideration.^ ....

.... I shall pay particular attention to the subject of Mr. Irwins ^ 
memorial and as I cannot perceive that there are grounds for a plausible 
pretext to refuse the prayer of it, I confide that his application to congress 
will be attended with success. I have made known the purpose of his 
errand to Middleton, Harrison and Wilson and others " who can melt 
at human woe." The Delegates from Char'town from whom opposition 
was to be expected if from any quarter, think him, too undesigning, too 
well disposed or too unfortunate to counteract his wishes, so at present 
it seems. 

I am well aware of the burden of publick business with which our 
removal hither has incumbered you. When in Philadelphia where we 
took a small share of it to ourselves I have been amazed how you waded 
thro' it, and found leisure for your own private concerns and the enjoy- 
ment of your friends. Congress seems unanimously sensible of the 
Obligations which they owe you, and you may boast of being the only 
man whom they all agree to speak and I really believe think well of. 

I earnestly wish however that we could have you here for a little while. 
The transactions of this and a few preceeding days have in my opinion 
strongly proved the necessity of it. We have moved very rapidly in 
business and while some compliment themselves upon increasing Industry 
and application, I think I can find the cause elsewhere and that the sud- 
denness of decision may be truly attributed to ignorance of the Subject. 
We have been holding forth new lines to France by offering what we have 
not to give and provided they will conquer the whole of Newfoundland 
and secure the fishing, that we will most bountifully and most graciously 
give them one half of it for their trouble. We have found out that the 
Duke of Tuscany is a potentate of much consequence, while some of us 
are such Ignoramuses as to think him very insignificant in the naval and

mercial matters his interest will attach him to us without much sollicita- 
tion But I anticipate an amusement which you have to come, the Picture 
of our follies will be the more pleasing from being viewed at full length. 

We have given Genl. Washington large and ample powers, fully 
equal to the object if America means to contend and support him. Thus 
the Business of War will for six months to come move in the proper 
channels and the Congress be no longer exercised about matters of which 
it is supremely ignorant. 

A Plan is in agitation to appoint executive powers out of doors, and 
resolve the business of Treasury, Board of War and of Commerce into 
the hands of persons not members of congress. A Committee is appointed 
for that purpose and you are a member of it.^ You will be much wanted. 
I wish if your attendance is impossible that you would reduce a few tho'ts 
to paper upon the subject of a Chamber of Commerce which is the Hobby 
Horse and for which I fancy we are indebted to the Abilities of Mr. 
P e.* 

I earnestly wish that the Congress could return to Philadelphia without 
hazarding the Ignominy of a second flight or the charge of Caprice. This 
dirty boggy hole beggars all description. We are obliged, except when 
the Weather paves the streets to go to Congress on Horseback, the way 
so miry that Carriages almost stall on the sides of them. When the Devil 
proffered our Saviour the Kingdoms of the World, he surely placed his 
thumb on this delectable spot and reserved it to himself for his own 
peculiar chosen seat and inheritance. As to the Inhabitants the congress 
can boast no acquaintance with them but what arises from their daily 
exorbitant claims upon our pockets The Congress meets tomor- 
row altho' it is Sunday. Why, Heaven knows. I cannot conceive unless 
it is to give us importance in the eyes of the very respectable Inhabitants 
of this place

Baltimore 30 Decemr. 1776. 
Gentlemen 

.... Upon mature deliberation of all circumstances Congress deem 
the speedy declaration of France and European Assistance so indispensibly 
necessary to secure the Independence of these States, that they have 
authorized you to make such tenders to France and Spain, as they hope, 
will prevent any longer delay of an event, that is judged so essential to 
the well-being of North America. Your wisdom we know, will direct 
you to make such use of these powers, as will procure the thing desired 
on terms as much short of the concessions now offered as possible; but 
no advantages of this kind are proposed at the risk of a delay, that may 
prove dangerous to the end in view, it must be very obvious to the Court 
of France, that, if Great Britain should succeed in her design of sub- 
jugating these States, their Inhabitants, now well trained to arms might 
be compelled to become Instruments for making conquest of the French 
Possessions in the West Indies, which would be a sad contrast to that 
security and commercial benefit, that would result from the independence 
of North America." .... 

The next oportunity will bring you the determination of Congress 
concerning the persons, that are to be sent to the Courts of Vienna, Prus- 
sia, Spain and the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In the meantime, it is hoped, 
that, through the medium of the Ambassadors from those Courts to that 
of France, you may be so fortunate, as to procure their friendly mediation 
for the purposes proposed by Congress.' .... 

Wishing you health, success, and many happy years we remain Honble.

I received your Letter of the 30th of November ^ and laid it before 
Congress, and took particular Notice of the very weak Condition of our 
State. Congress are sensible of its Situation; but as they have by a late 
resolve, which the President will by this Express transmit to you, with a 
circular Letter in which the Reasons for their Doings are contained, 
delegated to and invested Genl. Washington with the whole military 
Power for a limited Time, Application will properly be made to him in 
every Instance which respects the military Department.^ With Regard to 
the other Parts of your Letter, which were ordered to be laid before 
Congress, as they required no particular Observations none were made 
upon them either by Congress or Me.

inform yourself from the Loan Office Commrs. who of them is or may 
be best supplyed with Money and inform the Treasurer that he may send 
an order accordingly. 

in the Evening â€” I am just come from a Visit to our good Friend 
General Gates who is on the Recovery, which will doubtless give you 
pleasure. I suspect that a mercenary party at Albany have endeavoured 
to gravel you in supplying the army.Â® .... pray inform me whether you 
can [esta]blish a Magazine of provisions at Bennington for an army of 
lOCXX) Men for three Months and keep up the usual Supplies notwith- 
stand^ opposition and without the assistance of the Albany Gentleman;^ 
and if not, whether it would be a good plan to direct a certain Quantity 
to be provided in or near Albany by the York convention or General 
Schuyler to Supply the Militia that may occasionally come in, or answer 
any other Demands that may be found necessary during the next Cam- 
paign ? and also what Quality of provisions and Quantity should be thus 
ordered ? I think your powers and Connections may render this needless ; 
but as it can be done without interfering in your Department, if you think 
there is the le[ast] Chance of it's being necessary and advise thereto, 
[it] shall be adopted, the Bearer brings the Certificates to the Commis-

Measures in Pursuance thereof as soon as possible. Genl. Lee's Situa- 
tion seems to be extremely daiij^erous and critical; and from Genl. 
Howe's Behaviour to him. it is hig^hly probable, he will be broujj^ht to 
a Trial for Desertion, (icnl. Lee, it is said, by Mr. Eustace,* his Aid de 
Camp, having^ addressed two Letters to Genl. Howe, received them both 
back again unopened, and enclosed under a Cover directed to Lieutenant 
Colo Lee. I hope the Mag. which Congress ordered to be sent to make 
Inquiry into the Manner in which he is treated, has been di.spatched ; and 
a Remonstrance in Consequence of it, should the Information you have 
received of his Treatment, have rendered that Step necessary. 

You will please to propose an Exchange of the six Hessian Field 
Officers for him, and at the same Time, make Inquiry whether the 
Report which Congress have heard of Mr. Stockton's being confined in a 
Common Jail by the Enemy, has any Truth in it, or not."^ 

By a Letter which Congress yesterday received from Mr. Morris * we 
are informed, that Genl. Cadwalader, with the Troops under him, had 
joined your Army â€” that the Enemy were at Trenton â€” that the two 
Armies were divided only by a Creek, and that a General Engagement 
was hourlv expected. In the mean Time, Congress are infinitely anxious 
to hear the Event ; and humbly hope, that Victory has declared in Favor 
of those, wdiose sacred Cause should inspire them with Ardor, on every 
solemn Appeal to that Being, who hateth all Injustice, Tyranny, and 
Oppression. I have the honor to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem and 
Respect, Sir,

P. S. If the Desire of Congress to procure Genl. Lee's Exchange can- 
not be effected, and the Enemy, preferring the Gratification of Revenge 
to the Civility they owe their Hessian Auxiliaries, determine to keep or 
to abuse him, it will be very agreeable to Congress that their Determina- 
tion, with the enclosed Resolve be made known to the Hessians as fully 
as possible. To secure Genl. Lee as effectually as may be from personal 
Insult and Injury, Congress have come to the present Resolution; which 
you, Sir, are desired to convey to Genl. Howe, with all convenient Dis- 
patch. It will be very agreeable to Congress that the Hessian Field Officer 
intended to be exchanged for Colo. Ethan Allen be sent to notify it to 
Genl. Howe, taking his Parole to return in a fixt Time, if Colo. Allen is 
not returned in his Place. It will fall within the Wish of Congress if 
Colo. Rahl, or one of the Hessian Officers, should be also sent with the

Lee there appears to be a Design to consider him as a deserter and take 
away his Life. Congress have directed General Washington to acquaint 
Howe that if this is his Intention five of the Hessian field officers now^ in

a member of Congress, you have a right to know all that has been done ; 
but I dare not commit it to paper at a time when tiie safe carriage of 
letters is become so precarious. One thing I am very solicitous to inform 
you, because I know it will give you great satisfaction. If you recollect 
our conversation at New Haven, I fancy you will understand me when I 
tell you, that to one place we have added four, and increased the number 
of persons from three to six.' I hate this dark, mysterious manner of 
writing, but necessity requires it.* .... 

We have this day passed a recommendation to the Council of Massachu- 
setts Bay of a very important nature. It will be sent by this express to the 
Council, to whom I refer you for a perusal of it. 

Our affairs in France and Spain wear a promising aspect, and we have 
taken measures to put them on a respectable footing in other parts of 
Europe: and I flatter myself too much if we do not succeed 

You have seen the power with which General Washington is vested 
for a limited time." Congress is very attentive to the northern army, and 
care is taken effectually to supply it with every thing necessary this winter 
for the next campaign. General Gates is here. How shall we make him 
the head of that army ? " 

We are about establishing boards of war. ordnance, navy, and treasury, 
with a chamber of commerce, each of them to consist of gentlemen who 
are not members of Congress. By these means, I hope, our business will 
be done more systematically, speedily, and effectually.'' 

' The reference is evidently to the resolve, Dec. 30, to send commissioners to 
Vienna, Spain, Prussia, and Tuscany, in addition to France. On Jan. i Franklin, one 
of the three commissioners to France, was chosen commissioner to Spain, leaving three 
other places to fill. May i Arthur Lee was designated commissioner to Spain; May 7 
Ralph Izard was chosen commissioner to Tuscany ; and May 9 William Lee was elected 
for the courts of both Vienna and Berlin. Cf. the letter of the committee of secret 
correspondence. Feb. 19, Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 273.

^ See nos. 185. 246, 253, 258, 272, 273, 279, ante ; also no. 305, post. A committee of 
five was appointed Dec. 26, 1776, " to prepare a plan for the better conducting the 
executive business of Congress, by boards composed of persons, not members of 
Congress ". On Jan. 9 two members were added to the committee, which is usually 
denominated the committee on departments. The first outcome of the committee efforts 
was the organization, Mar. 22, of the office of Secretary of Congress. On Apr. 8 
the committee reported a plan for a board of war and ordnance (the report is in the 
Journals, under that date), but the consideration of it was postponed, and on April 12 it 
was recommitted. On June 6 the committee was instructed to " proceed on the business 
committed to them, and make report as soon as possible ". On July 18 it was resolved to 
appoint a board of war, consisting of three gentlemen, not members of Congress, but 
to conduct the business under the direction of the existing board composed of members. 
The appointment of this board was set for July 22, was then postponed, and the next 
action recorded is the consideration, Oct. 16, of a report from the committee on depart- 
ments. The plan was adopted, after amendment, Oct. 17, and on Nov. 7 the members 
of the board were appointed. They were Thomas Mifflin, Tim.othy Pickering, and R. H. 
Harrison. Mifflin and Pickering accepted (see the Journals, Nov. 18, 21) and Harrison 
declined (ibid., Nov. 21). Upon the recommendation of the member board Nov. 24 
(see the Journals of that day, also Nov. 21, 22) it was resolved to appoint two additional 
members, and on Nov. 27 General Gates, Richard Peters, and Joseph Trumbull were 
chosen, with Gates as president (see no. 700, note 4, post). A reduction in the member- 
ship to two members of Congress and three commissioners not members of Congress

Great and heavy complaints have been made of abuse in the Director- 
General's department in both our armies; some, I suppose, without 
grounds, others with too much reason. I have no doubt but as soon as a 
committee reports, which is expected this day, both Morgan and Stringer 
will be removed, as I think they ought. 

to the eighty-eight battalions ordered to be raised, sixteen are to be 
added, which, with six to be raised out of the continent at large, will make 
one hundred and ten, besides three thousand horse, three regiments of 
artillery, and a company of engineers.* We may expect fifty or sixty 
thousand of the enemy in June next. Their design will still be to subdue 
the obstinate States of New England. It was the intention that Carleton 
should winter in Albany, Howe in New York, and Clinton at Rhode 
Island, that, with reenforcements in the spring, they might be ready to 
attack New England on all sides. I hope every possible method will be 
used to quicken the new levies, and that the fortifications in the harbor of 
Boston will be in complete readiness. Much will depend upon our dili- 
gence this winter. 

The attention of Congress is also turned to the southward. Forts Pitt 
and Randolph are to be garrisoned, and provisions laid up for two 
thousand men six months. By the last accounts from South Carolina, 
we are informed that late arrivals have supplied them with every thing 
necessary for their defence.

was made Oct. 29, 1778 (see also the Journals, Apr. 21, 1778), but otherwise, though with 
numerous changes of personnel, the board remained thus constituted until 1781. Feb. 
7, 1781, Congress established the departments of finance, war, and marine. The post of 
Secretary at War was filled Oct. 30, 1781, by the appointment of Benjamin Lincoln, who 
accepted Nov. 26. 

The first steps of importance toward a reconstitution of the treasury were taken 
Apr. 15, 1778, when a plan was brought in proposing a board of five members not of 
Congress. On Aug. 13 there was a report by a committee upon this report, and Sept. 26 
an " arrangement " of the treasury was adopted, leaving the board however still composed 
of members of Congress. In April, 1779 (see the Journals, Apr. 13, 22, 27), further 
modifications were proposed, and July 30 an ordinance was passed establishing a board 
of treasury consisting of three persons not members of Congress and two members. 
The department remained thus constituted until February, 1781 (see above), when Robert 
Morris was appointed Superintendent of Finance (Feb. 20). The first steps toward shift- 
ing the administration of the navy to others than members of Congress were the appoint- 
ment in November, 1776, of a board of naval experts in Philadelphia, and in April, 1777, 
of a similar board for the Eastern states, both to be under the direction of the marine 
committee. Two and a half years later, Oct. 28, 1779, a board of admiralty was created, 
consisting of three persons not members of Congress and two members. Upon the 
reorganization of the department, Feb. 7, 1781, Gen. Alexander McDougall was chosen 
Secretary of Marine (Feb. 27), but he declined, and the office was never filled. 

Apparently the only outcome of the project of establishing a " Chamber of Commerce " 
was the creation, July 5, 1777, of a committee of commerce to supersede the secret com- 
mittee. This committee, with somewhat enlarged powers, was reconstituted Dec. 14, 1778.

Sir 

We have just reed the dispatches from Congress delivered herewith to 
Colo. Hartley, and having reed. Copies of the Resolves of Congress 
therein enclosed to you, we cannot help saying they have been liberal in 
their offers to regain Genl Lee, and altho we have not only a high opinion 
of his merits and abilities as an officer but also a personal regard for him, 
yet we are apt to think we shou'd have opposed these offers had we been 
in Congress, at least some of us are of that opinion, however this is not 
to the purpose at present.^ We observe that Congress direct you to pro- 
pose an agreement whereby Prisoners may be supplyed with provisions at 
the Expence or upon the Credit of the States.' We recommended to Con- 
gress to appoint an Agent of their own to attend the Prisoners and see 
justice done them and to prevent their enlisting w'ith the Enemy * and if 
this is not done the plan will be incompleat, as we are inclined to believe 
our People suffer by the peculation of the Commissarys that have the 
care of them, and not by the allowance ordered by the Commander in 
Chief. We think such an agent might be admitted on each side, under 

parole not to give intelligence

James Wilson Esqr. 

Sir 

In consequence of the late resolution of Congress to erect a Magazine at 
Carlisle ^ we have applied to Mr. Nicholas Hicks, a Bricklayer of the 
first reputation here, to superintend the work, it is yet much too early in 
the Year to begin it, but we have thought it expedient to forward him to 
prepare the necessary Materials, and engage the proper workmen in which 
agreeable to your offer you will no doubt give him all the assistance in 
your power. Congress having fixed on one large Building to store their 
ammunition at Carlisle, we had some intention of suggesting to them our 
own thoughts on this matter which are that it would be safer both on 
account of Fire, a sudden surprize of an Enemy, to lodge the ammunition 
in two or more smaller buildings detached from each other at suitable 
distances, but whatever alteration this opinion of ours might induce Con- 
gress to make in their resolution, Mr Hicks present business may go on 
without interuption.

Baltimore, Jany loth, 1777. 
Gentlemen. 

I have it in Command to forward the enclosed Resolve, and to request 
you will bestow that Attention to it, which its great Importance demands. 
To you, the Congress have submitted the Propriety of making an Attack 
upon the Province of Nova Scotia, with a View to destroy the immense 
Quantities of military Stores, that are there deposited to be employed 
against us.^ 

I need not particularise the vast Advantages, or the Glory, resulting 
from this Expedition, could it be happily carried into Execution. Nor 
need I suggest Motives to stimulate you to undertake it. Being fully 
convinced, that if it shall appear to you practicable and calculated to 
advance the Interest of America, you will most certainly adopt it. I shall 
only add that the Destruction of above Half a Million of Stores, must be 
a severe Blow on the Enemy, and may possibly prove a principal Mean of 
ridding our Country of those cruel Foes, who with impious Hands have 
been spreading Ruin and desolation over it, to the utmost of their Power,

PniLADA. Jany. 12th. 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

.... You undoubtedly must have been well acquainted with the rapid 
prog^ress made by our Enemies through the Jerseys, and the danger to 
which this City has been exposed for some weeks past, and you will have 
heard of the removal of Congress to Baltimore in the midst of the pannic; 
this step has been highly censured by many of their Friends and un- 
doubtedly lost them the confidence of some valuable Men. 

I confess for my own part, I am not amongst the number of those that 
Censure them for this hasty measure, for when it is considered that the 
Enemy's Troops were within a very few miles of us and no apparent 
Force sufficient to oppose their progress, it surely was time for a public 
body on which the support of the American cause so much depended, to 
provide for their safety, mcer personal safety I suppose would not have 
induced many of them to fly, but their security as a body was the object, 
had any number of them fallen into the Enemies hands so as to break up 
the Congress, America might have been ruined before another choice of 
Delegates could be had and in such an event they would have been deemed 
criminal and rash to the last degree.^ ....

Philadelphia Jany. 12th 1777. 
Sir, 

.... When the British troops made such a rapid progress through 
the Jerseys and got wnthin a few miles of us, the Congress thought proper 
to remove to Baltimore, at that time I sent my family, my books, papers 
and considerable effects into Maryland but having still a great value here 
and being desirous of spiriting up our people, all in my power, I deter- 
mined to wait until the last, happy in having done so, as I have had an 
opportunity of being very useful both to this country and the general 
cause; the Congress know this well, and have appointed myself and two 
others that remained here, a Committee with full powers to transact all 
Continental business that may be proper and necessary here." .... 

304. John Hancock to Robert Morris.*

at same time your interference under the then circumstances was abso- 
lutely necessary; I dare say your disposition of the several Arm'd Vessels 
after you are fully convinc'd of the Removal of the Ships from your 
Capes, will fully meet the approbation of Congress. Without the least 
appearance of Flattery I can assure you your whole Conduct since our 
Flight is highly approv'd, and happy I am that you Remain'd, many agree- 
able Consequences have Resulted from it, and your continu'd Exertions 
will be productive of great good, I must therefore beg you will continue 
as long as you can tho' I sincerely wish you a happy Sight of good Mrs 
Morris, but I fear your departure from Philadelphiamight occasion relaxation 
that would be prejudicial. I know however you will put things in a 
proper way, indeed all depends upon you, and you have my hearty thanks 
for your unremitting Labours, the Publick are much Indebted to you, and 
I hope to see the Day when those publick Acknowledgments shall be made 
you.'^ 



in point of Convenience I wish to return to Philadelphia which brings me 
to the hint in your Letter. I think Sir, that as the Printing presses are 
here and set to work, and as money is so exceedingly wanted, and a 
Removal just at this Time would occasion so great a Delay, that it would 
not be prudent to think, unless thro' the greatest necessity of a removal 
at present, nor untill the last of March, by that time I hope we shall be able 
to return or to fix upon some other place for our Residence that must 
depend on circumstances. As things have turn'd out I am very sorry vy^e 
Remov'd at all, and indeed I think we were full hasty enough, it damp'd 
people much, but your Continuance there and Conducting Business there 
will give a Spring, and Join'd to the Influence of our Successes will make 
up for the Flight of Congress.* .... 

We have not yet had a Representation from New York, Delaware or 
Maryland, the latter is rather strange 

305. James Wilson to Robert Morris.^ 

Carlisle 14th. Jany. 1777 
Dear Sir 

Congress see, at last, the Propriety of distributing the executive Busi- 
ness of the Continent into different Departments, managed by Gentlemen, 
not Members of Congress, and whose whole Time and Attention can be 
devoted to the Business committed to their Charge. Measures were 
adopted, when I left Baltimore, for making the necessary Arrangements.^ 

There is an Office, which, I believe, would be of considerable use to the 
Public, if properly discharged. I will describe to you my Ideas of it. 

The Duties of the office should be â€” to manage all Admiralty Causes, 
on Behalf of the Continent, in the Courts of Admiralty and Appeal, where 
the Congress sets â€” to conduct all Enquiries and Prosecutions instituted 

2 See nos. 245, 255, 269, 270, 271, 285, 290, ante.

Philadelphia; Henkels, Catalogue, no. 1183, item 100.

2 

by Congress â€” to give his opinions upon such Questions in the civil and 
Maritime I^ivvs. and the Law of Nations as shall be stated to him, for that 
Purpose, by Congress, the Hoard of Admiralty, the Board of Commerce, 
or the Committee of secret Correspondence â€” to draw, or reduce to Form, 
public Instruments, when required by Congress, or the Boards, or Com- 
mittee aforesaid. 

Several other Duties naturally fall to his Share, which cannot be enu- 
merated nor comprised under any general Head. 

The Propriety of the tirst Article is obvious. I shall suggest one 
Advantage, that will probably result from it. It will be of Importance 
that the Laws and Practice of the Courts of Admiralty should be brought, 
as soon and as well as possible, into a System. By the Intervention of 
Juries, which are unknown in the Admiralty Courts of other Countries, 
this is rendered a Matter of much Delicacy and Difficulty. The uniform 
Practice of one, whose Duty and Business it would be to make the Subject 
his particular Study, would be of considerable Use. All conversant in 
Courts know that they receive a Tincture from the Practitioners well as 
from the Judges. 

The second Head of the Duty of this Ofificer is, in my Opinion, abso- 
lutely necessary. Enquiries must be had into the management of public 
Affairs, Prosecutions also must be instituted against public Ofificers, who 
are accused of mal-conduct. When a Committee is appointed for such 
Purpose; it is every Body's Business to manage matters â€” you know the 
Consequence â€” it is no Body's Business. The Friends of the Person 
accused think themselves, and are thought by others, justified in doing 
every Thing in his Behalf. It is troublesome â€” it is disagreeable, without 
having an official Obligation and an official Justification, to undertake 
the Task of Prosecutor, to manage the Examination of Witnesses who 
appear, to direct others to be sent for, w^ho, from the Course of the Tes- 
timony, are discovered to be capable of throwing Light upon the Subject, 
and to take many other Steps, without which the matter cannot be sifted 
to the Bottom. The Result is, that Things are superficially passed over, 
without Satisfaction, to the Public, to those who make the Enquiry, or 
him, concerning whom it is made; provided he has been innocent. An 
Officer, appointed to manage Enquiries and Prosecutions, on Behalf of 
the Public, would prevent these ^lischiefs. 

The Third Branch of the Duty of this Officer is by far the most im- 
portant. I hope the United States will never be involved far in the Maze 
of European Politics ; but it is incumbent upon us to know something of 
them, even to steer clear of them. Every Letter from our Commissioners 
at foreign Courts almost every Resolution of Congress about foreign 
Affairs will bring into View some Principle of the civil or maritime Law, 
or of the Law of Nations. It is impossible for ^lembers of Congress, 
however enlarged their Genius, and however extensive their Knowledge 
may be, accurately to investigate Subjects of this kind amidest the Hurry 
of so much other Business, which likewise demands their Attention. 
Treaties are considered, in Europe as a Kind of Science. In our Transac- 
tions with European States, it is certainly of Importance neither to trans- 



January, lyy/ 217 

gress, nor to fall short of those Maxims by which they regulate their 
Conduct towards one another. 

All States, as far as I know, have an Office similar to that which I 
have described. It includes Part of the office of Advocate General, and 
Part of that of Attorney General in England. 

If your sentiments upon the subject correspond with mine, you will 
mention it to Congress. If they agree to institute the office, and no one 
offers for it better qualified, in your opinion, than myself, I will be obliged 
to you for proposing me. My Reading and Course of Studies have been 
such as in some Measure, to prepare me for it. One thing I can engage â€” 
that no Pains nor Industry shall be wanting, on my Part, to qualify 
myself as fully for it as possible. 

I have expressed myself with all the openness of a Friend to a Friend. 
I would not mention the Subject, if I did not think it of Consequence. 1 
would not mention myself, if I did not think I could be of Service in this 
Line. I have not been so unsuccessful in private Life, as to be obliged 
to obtrude myself upon the Public. 

You will make such Use of what I have written as your Judgment and 
your Friendship shall tell you is proper, 

I am Dear Sir

I have been favoured with your letter of the 7th Inst, and as it prin-

you that the members who at Phila. constituted that Committee are at 
present absent, and from the pressing applications of Generals Washing- 
ton, Schuyler and Col Knox for Cannon, the Congress has appointed 
Messrs. Haywood [Heyward], Whipple, and Self to that department,^ 
a department that is quite new to us and therefore cannot be executed with 
the prescision we could wish, especialy as Mr. Paine (the former Chair- 
man) has taken with him all the documents relative to that board. 

Pursuant to the aforesaid applications, Congress has directed the Com- 
mittee to procure Ten six Inch Brass Howitzers, forwarded to Tycon- 
deroga as soon as may be,^ we are therefore of opinion that Mr. Byers * 
be immediately employed in casting those Howitzers, and the Council of 
Safety at Phila. be desired to agree with him upon the best terms they can, 
but should Mr. Byers for want of proper Moulds or by other obstructions, 
be incapable of casting Howitzers, [in] that case he should be employed

nature, that partiality will often (and perhaps impreceptably [sic^ ) influ- 
ence the minds of indeviduals when the interest of a particular State is 
immediately concerned.^ 

I have the pleasure to inform you that Congress has seriously con- 
sidered your late application relative to clothing the troops raising in 
your State, and they have promised to exert their utmost abilities to effect 
that necessary business. In September last, Congress requested the 
Legislatures of the several States to appoint to their respective States a 
Commissary, for the purpose of purchasing all necessary clothing, and 
in November the Secret Committee sent ofÂ¥ two agents (one of them 
Mr. Abm. Livingston) with instructions to confer with those commis- 
saries in each State, as far eastward as New-Hampshire, to assist in the 
purchasing and procuring said clothing, to make returns of the quantity 
and quality, both to Congress and Genl. Washington, to be distributed to 
such troops as shall be enlisted upon the new establishment, but we have 
not as yet received any advice from those gentlemen.* ....

Dear Sir, 

I am favored with yours by Maj. Johnston, and I should certainly have 
served him to the utmost of my power in Congress, if the appointment 
you proposed for Maj. Johnston had not now been in another channel. 
You know Sir, that by resolve of Congress the General is to fill up all 
vacancies in the Continental troops that shall happen for six months from 
the date of the resolve.^ I have recommended it to the Major to get a 
letter from you and the council, with one from Colonel Harrison, to the 
General in his favour, and if he is very intent on success, to carry them 
himself. I think this will not fail to procure him the commission he 
desires, and in the mean time, the Liutenants \_sic'\ and Ensign may be 
recruiting the company.^ ....

It appears reasoiiahk- and jii^t to us that all officers and soldiers in the 
Continental Service should be entitled to their Pay while they remain 
Prisoners in the Hands of the Enemy, and this Pay to continue such a 
number of days after their Discharge as may be sufficient for their return 
home. And wherever it appears to you from proper Proofs and Testi- 
monials that this has been the Case of any Officers or Soldiers within your 
department as Paymaster we are of opinion you ought to make good their 
Pay to the times above mentioned, previously taking care to deduct such 
sums as they may have already received.

The Affairs of our Country were perhaps never so critical, as they

tormented with Doubt, and Uncertainty. I hope therefore, for the future, 
you will not let us be so long without hearing from you, but will send us

Alteration since your last.

Dollars will be exhausted, and by your accounts the Loan Office in your

As there is not a more distin.c^uislied Event in the History of America, 
than the Declaration of her Independence â€” nor any, that, in all probabil- 
ity, will so much excite the Attention of future Ages, it is highly proper, 
that the Memory of that Transaction, together with the Causes that gave 
Rise to it, should be preserved in the most careful Manner that can be 
devised, 

I am therefore commanded by Congress to transmit you the enclosed 
Copy of the Act of Independence, with the List of the several Members 
of Congress subscribed thereto â€” and to request that you will cause the 
same to be put upon Record, that it may henceforth form a Part of the 
Archives of your State, and remain a lasting Testimony of your Approba- 
tion of that necessary and important Measure.^

The Removal of Congress to this Place and the Interruption Occasioned 
thereby in the affairs of the Treasury, have prevented an early Reimburse- 
ment of the Money applyed for by the State of Massachusetts Bay, an 
Order was obtained at Philadelphia for Â£50,000 lawful,^ which with 
300,000 Dollars for supplying the military Chest of the eastern Depart- 
ment and payment of the Bounties to the new Levies of your State, will 
be sent from hence in about ten Days.^ We have obtained an Order on 
the Loan Office at Boston for Â£50,000 in addition to the Sums already 
mentioned, which will be sent by the president and compleats the Â£100,000 
required by the State.'* We are concerned to find that the Interest on the 
[Loan Office] Certificates must continue at the Rate of 4 per Cent, being 
fully persuaded that this unreasonable Oeconomy will impede the Success 
of the Loan, and burthen the Continent with a greater Expence by the 
Depreciation that will result from further Emissions.^

to be for the question." this I can venture to assure you that in all debates 
of this kind Congress seems determined to put all disputes between 
individuals, and even between States about property out of sight, as 
debates of this kind the last year between the States of Connecticut and 
Pensylvania took up the whole attention of Congress to the great detri- 
ment of the service and but to very little effect. I am well satisfied in my 
own mind that Congress has not the least Idea as a collective body of 
suffering any State to be dismembered whatever the secret views of indi- 
viduals may be, but permit me to say that to leave our State so long 
unrepresented in Congress is a fault when I observe to you that the four 
N E States allways keep a full representation when in some debates those 
States may be injured who are not represented; Congress has often com- 
plained to me of this neglect, and indeed urged it in their public resolves 
but to no effect hitherto ; â€” I hope the Convention will Speedily remedy 
this Evil. I liave for this six weeks past been the only member to repre-

My dear Sir, 

.... I lament, my dear Sir, the very small representation which 
America presents in Conq-ress the members will soon be reduced to the 
number of 22. ' how unequal to the importance of its councils ! I am sorry 
to say that I think they already savour of the truth of an Observation 
contrasted to that in holy Writ. That in the Multitude of Counsellors 
there is wisdom. Some of the middle and Southern colonies have much 
to answer for in their want of representation. It is a Crime however 
which carries its own punishment with it, and if there are two Interests 
in America, that must necessarily prevail which always has its advocates 
on the spot to promote it. while the other is deserted by those whom every 
tie of honour, Duty and publick virtue should induce to a different conduct. 
New York Delaware, Maryland may almost as well desert the Cause as 
so lamely support it by their appearance in its publick Councils.' .... 

I wish some expedient could be fallen upon to put our monied matters 
in a proper train the demands upon us at present are immense and must 
continue so, like beginners in every thing else we want Oeconomy or 
rather want System. Unless officers are appointed competent to the 
management of our funds we must be ruined, from a false parsimony in 
saving hundreds in salaries of proper Officers we are sporting away 
millions in the w^ant of them. I wish the Loan Office may suceed at 
4 p Cent the Southern Colonies will not consent to raise it they consider 
the Eastern Governments as in possession of almost all the Continental 
currency, and the rise to 5 as only a prelude to a higher demand and that 
in proportion to our necessities.* ....

Upon Motion in Congress whether the meeting held by the four New 
Engd States by deputies at Providence Decemr 25 1776 was a proper one 
and wdiether it did not stand in need of the Approbation of Congress to 
make it valid. 

It was said by Mr Saml Adams. That a right to assemble upon all 
occasions to consult measures for promoting liberty and happiness was 
the priviledge of freemen â€” that it was contested by Govr Hutchinson and 
that it was dreaded only by tyrants. 

Mr Richd Henry Lee. It was said on the same side of the question 
that we were not yet confederated â€” therefore no law of the Union 
infringed. 

Col: Wilson on the negative said that the design in the committee of 
the 4 New England States in sending their proceedings to Congress was 
to demand their approbation 

That the same was clearly intimated by the tenor of the appointments 
from Rhode Island and Connecticut â€” that the committee had commanded, 
and countermanded continental troops â€” that the said troops were to be 
paid by the continent â€” therefore that the business the Committee trans- 
acted was wholly continental and of course required the approbation of 
Congress. 

Mr John Adams said that he lately travelled thro' New Eng"^ and 
that he was sure that the approbation of the Congress of the meeting 
would give pleasure to the committee and their constitutents. That their 
meeting was founded in necessity, that Altho' we were not confederated 
the same principles of equity and reason should govern us as if we were 
united by a confederacy â€” that the four New England States bore the same 
relation to the Congress that four counties bore to a single State. These 
four counties have a right to meet to regulate roads, and affairs that relate 
to the poor, but they have no right to tax or execute any other branch of 
legislation. In like manner the four New Eng*^ States, or any other four

States have a right to meet upon matters wholly indifferent, but they 
have no right to touch upon Continental Subjects â€” that the committee 
from the 4 New Eng"* States have touched upon continental Subjects, 
therefore the Meeting stands in need of the Approbation of the Congress. 

Dr Rush. The desire of independance is natural not only to individuals 
but to communities. There was a time (near 200 years) when it was 
wrong to say a word agst. the dependance of the colonies upon Great 
Britain. A time came when it was equally criminal to enforce that depen- 
dance. The time may come and probably will come when it will be the 
interest of the united States to be independant of each other, but I can con- 
ceive of no temporal punishment to be severe eno' for that man who 
attempts to dissolve, or weaken the Union for a century or two to come. 
I admire the proceedings of the committee assembled at Providence. 
They are full of political virtue and wisdom, and I think the other States 
will act wisely and virtuously in proportion as they resemble them. But 
I think the Meeting is full of great and interesting consequences, and 
should be regarded with a serious and jealous eye. Their business was 
chiefly continental, and therefore they usurped the powers of congress as 
much as four counties would usurp the powers of legislation in a state 
shd. they attempt to tax themselves. The committee have in one instance 
in regulating the price of goods counterved [contravened?] an express 
resolution of congress, and lastly tho' the meeting was necessary and no 
injustice intended or done by it to any state, yet it becomes us to remember 
that arbitrary power has often originated in justice and necessity. 

This question was decided by a majority in the Committee of the Whole 
house in the aMrmative, but in the negative a few days afterwards. It 
was reconsidered Feby 13rd. ^

Thursday Noon 
Gentlemen. 

Congress are very anxious that some immediate Steps should be taken 
by our State, not only as to the person of Captain Patterson, but as to the 
Payment of the Engagement entered into by the Continental and your 
Agent. Capt. Patterson is viewed as a pirate and after examination, if 
the facts should appear to you to be well founded, it may be well to con- 
sider, if it would not be proper to send him to Martinico for trial there, by 
the law of nations. If our State shall pay the value of the vessel and 
goods seised by Patterson, would it not be proper to inform the Governor 
of Martinique that the whole would have been returned, but for the 
Risque. If no remittance can be made but by produce, it will be an equal 
risque to send back the vessel. Could not Mr. Morris pay the money for 
our State? An opportunity of writing will present itself in a few days. 
Would it not be proper for our State to write a letter, disavowing the con- 
duct of Capt. Patterson, and engaging payment as soon as possible and 
mentioning the men of war in our Bay, which may delay the remittance.* 

.... I must again repeat the necessity of a Representation.*

I am at last, after a great deal of difficulty, settled in comfortable 
quarters,^ but at an infinite expense. The price I pay for my board is more 
moderate than any other gentlemen give, excepting my colleagues, who 
are all in the same quarters and at the same rates, except Mr. Hancock, 
who keeps a house by himself. The prices of things here are much more 
intolerable than at Boston, The attempt of New England to regulate 
prices is extremely popular in Congress, who will recommend an imitation 
of it to the other States.^ For my own part I expect only a partial and a 
temporary relief from it, and I fear that, after a time, the evils will break 
out with greater violence. The water will flow with greater rapidity for 
having been dammed up for a time. The only radical cure will be to stop 
the emission of more paper, and to draw in some that is already out, and 
devise means effectually to support the credit of the rest. To this end we 
must begin forthwith to tax the people as largely as the distressed circum- 
stances of the country will bear. We must raise the interest from four 
to six per cent.* We must, if possible, borrow silver and gold from 
abroad. We must, above all things, endeavor, this winter, to gain further 
advantages of the enemy, that our power may be in somewhat higher 
reputation than it is, or rather, than it has been.

was best Judge how many of her citizens She would Trust, and to what 
length she would Trust them, that there was no need of publicly calling 
on them for a representation more full because they had already wished 
the same thing but found it Inconvenient to be Effected that therefore

Duty, but this was not the fault of his Country, who could not prevail on 
lier abler men to undertake a Business so arduous and Inconvenient, 
that She had Indeed appointed three but never Expected that they should 
be always in Service at Once, because the absence was too long from their 
private Families and Affairs, and She had not Funds to support a greater

Illness, the other had Just departed and after a long attendance was per-

the Misfortune of the Delegate on whom, all Incompetent as he is, the 
burthen of so high a Trust had fallen and also the misfortune of his 
Country who in the absence of his more able Colleagues could not be so 
well served, that Considering it as a matter which each state had an 
Exclusive right to Judge of, the Delegate could not agree that Congress 
should at all Interfere with it, that having Just informed the Congress 
that one of the [delegates had been] permitted by his Countr>' to return, 
and that the [consequence is] that only two would be in service the 
Delegate considered the Ammendment relative to three is [as] implying 
a Censure on his Country and he must therefore protest against it. The 
Intention to Censure was disclaimed.^

After some debate it was resolved by a majority of one State only not to 
put the (Question. One State was accidentally unrepresented for a few 
minutes or it would have been carried in the Affuinative. The principal 
desig^n of this letter is to request that you would urge the necessity of our 
returning to Philadelphiain your next letter. By our Absence from Philadelphia
we not only depreciate the money there, but we likewise depreciate it by 
our residence here. The scarcity of Artificers, the want of sufficient 
number of boarding houses, the constant accession of Strangers who have 
business with the Congress and who create a fluctuation in the Quantity 
of provisions brought into the town have rendered the price of living, and 
transacting business of all kinds three times as high in this place as it is 
in many parts of the Continent, and Nearly twice as high as in Philadel- 
phia. But there are other considerations which ought to influence us. 
Our return will have the same effect upon our politicks that General 
Washington's late successes have had upon our Arms. Its operation per- 
haps may not be confined to the Continent. It may serve our cause even 
in the Court of France.^ 

Your letter produced another motion in Congress of greater conse- 
quence than the one just now mentioned, namely to raise the interest of 
money received into our loan Offices to 6 per Cent. It produced a very 
long, and serious debate. The question was postponed 'till Monday next 
at the request of Connecticut. There is good reason to believe from the 
part the several States took in the debate that it will be carried in the 
Affirmative by a majority of two or three States. Col. R. H. Lee has 
changed his mind upon this subject, and was one of the warmest Advo- 
cates for raising the interest upon the floor.* 

We live here in a Convent, we converse only with one another. We are 
precluded from all opportunities of feeling the pulse of the public upon our 
measures. We rely upon the Committee of Philadelphiato feel it for us, and 
we expect once more to hear thro' you how it beats upon the subject of 
returning to Philadelphia.

borrower, must get the money at the interest already offered, if there was 
any to be lent ; that those who withheld money, only did it in hopes our 
necessity would compel us to give a higher interest, and that they would 
withhold it as long as they had any prospect of forcing us to offer higher 
interest; that the interest would be a heavy and unequal burthen on the 
State, because those who now possess the money would lay the rest under 
a heavy tax under the name of interest ; that there was little money to be 
borrowed, because men speculated and found they could lay it out to 
better advantage; that the necessity for money made it more expedient 
to seek a more certain resource. The delegate of North Carolina could 
not be satisfied that Loan Office certificates, and bills of credit, where both 
had the same security for their redemption, were not in effect the same 
thing : he therefore thought Loan certificates another emission in bills of 
another denomination, with this unjust inequality, that one part of the 
community would thereby be taxed for the others. He also thought that 
much money would not be borrowed on them at any interest, unless it 
was for the more convenient purposes of exchange, and he thought it 
would give our enemies too convenient a machine for affecting our hopes 
and fears. He would vote against a Loan altogether if it were now the 
question, and the same reasons induced him to vote against the increase 
of interest. Question put, Aye 5, no 5. Aye, â€” New Hampshire, M. Bay, 
N. Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia. No. â€” Rhode Island, Connecticut,

346. Thomas Burke, Abstract of Debates.^ 

Fehy 8th. An adjournment to Philadelphia was moved for and post- 
poned ^ A Resolve was moved for offering 6 pet. Interest in the Loan 
Office the Debate took up greatest part of the Day, and the determination 
was postponed at the request of Connecticut.' 

The Arguments chiefly were that money was absolutely Necessary for 
carrying on the War, that four per ct which was already offered could not 
procure it and it was therefore Necessary to Increase the Interest, that 
this mode was more eligeable than a farther Emission because it would 
draw out of Circulation that superfluous quantity which occasioned the 
Rise of all prices, that the alluring monied men to embark in one Com- 
mon Interest with the other orders of men would greatly add to the 
Security of our Independence. 

In answer it was urged that the Offering a higher Interest would not 
more certainly procure the money, for those who had it to lend would 
find no borrower but the public, and those who had not could not lend it 
on any Interest, that the Interest would be an Accumulating Debt (if it 
could be borrowed) under which the Country must Sink, that the States 
would be very unequally burthened because those who now possessed the 
greater part of the Money would lay the other States under a heavy Tax

to them under the name of Interest, that [when] tliere were in the 
Country no money Lenders [every] man found that every (hiy's Occur- 
rences [ofTered him] Opportunities of layinj^ out his money to much 
i,'reater advantage, tliat however Necessary the money might be it was 
still the more Necessary to fall on some Expedient that might procure it 
with certainty, that the Increase of Interest having been tried in many 
States without EfTect very clearly proved money was not to be borrowed. 
North Carolina urged that it was a clear Truth that money was Necessary, 
it was equally clear that it was advisable to prevent further lunissions and 
to reduce the quantity in circulation if it was possible to Effect it. the 
Delegate declared that when he ofTered his thoughts before that Illus- 
trious assembly he did it with the greatest Diffidence and deference that 
he should not trouble them with any on so abstruce and Intricate a Sub- 
ject as the present, but that he perceived the matter had not Struck any 
other in the same point of View that it did him, that he felt himself 
Oppressed with the weight of the Question, and having the misfortune 
Singly to have the vote of one State to give he wished to do it on Estab- 
lished Principles, and the clearest conviction, he therefore beged their 
Indulgence and candor if he should ofTer objections which had been 
answered in some former Debates (for there had been many on that 
Subject) which he had not the Good fortune to Hear, he urged that he 
had not been able to derive any Satisfactory Information from the Debate 
that the money could be had by way of Loan on any Interest, or that 
money raised by way of Loan would not be a further Emission in Efifect, 
that he perceived there were few or no money lenders in the Country, 
that Farmers and Gentlemen speculated, and reserved their [money] for 
purchases, and Merchants, always reived on employing.

I am much alarmed with Gen^' Washington's Prod", of the 25th 
Janry. he hath assumed the Legislative and Executive powers of Govern- 
ment in all the states. I moved Congress to pass a Resolution I produced 
for preventing its fatal Consequences and the Establishing such a prece-

Legislature will take proper Notice of it, whatever issue it may have in 
Congress, and not tamely Submit their Authority to the Controul of a 
power unknown in our Constitution; We set out to Oppose Tyranny in 
all its Strides, and I hope we shall persevere. 

A Regulation for providing Carriages for the Army and to prevent as 
much as possible the Custom of impressing hath long been before Con- 
gress Com^*^. and recom*'^. and so it remains. I Wish you will not delay 
passing a Law for Regulating impresses of this kind.Â° .... The Devas- 
tations of New Jersey by the Enemy will I think make it Necessary to 
prevent Cattle etc. running at large, as fences on the main road are mostly 
destroyed and cannot soon be made, and I think, no person ought to be 
compelled to fence agst. street Cattle at any Time. Mr. Sergeant talks 
of resigning and i\Ir. Stockton by his late proceedure cannot Act.Â® I wish 
their places may be Supplied by such as will be reputable to New Jersey,

^ See nos. 290, 291, ante. The allusion to Stockton's " late proceedure " is doubt- 
less to a step taken during his imprisonment, the nature of which has been left in ob- 
scurity. From a statement made to the editor by the late Mr. William Nelson of 
Paterson, N. J., it is understood that he had at one time seen a document which revealed 
the nature of Stockton's act. Since the foregoing was put in type there has come to 
light a letter from John Witherspoon to his son, David Witherspoon. written from 
Philadelphia, Mar. 17, 1777. which casts additional light upon the case of Richard Stock- 
ton. The pertinent passage is as follows : " I was at Princeton from Saturday s'en 
night till Wednesday. Your uncle is well. Old Mr. Serjeant is dead of the Small Pox. 
Judge Stockton is not very well in health and much spoken against for his conduct. He 
signed Howe's Declaration and also gave his Word of Honour that he would not meddle 
in the least in American affairs during the War. Mrs. Cochran was sent to the Ennemies 
Lines by a Flag of truce, and when Mr. Cochran came out to meet his wife he said to 
the Officers that went with the Flag that Judge Stockton had brought evidence to 
General Howe to prove that he was on his Way to seek a protection when he was taken, 
this he denies to be true yet many credit it, but Mr. Cochran's known quarrel with him 
makes it very doubtful to candid persons." Catalogue, no. 5 (April, 1922) of the

2 That loan office tickets are the same as money, and therefore in case 
of the want of money new emissions are equally proper. 

In the affirmative it was said by Mr Sergant That loan office tickets 
would be confined only to one State. 

By Mr. Jas. Wilson â€” That Bonds, lands etc. were transferrable as well 
as loan office tickets, and therefore the argument of their being the same 
as money is without force. That the money lenders had all their money 
paid into them, that 3 millions had been received by the usurers in Pen- 
sylvania all of which was probably in thier hands, and that if the interest 
was raised to 6 per cent it wd. procure money. 

Mr John Adams. That loan offices tickets would not circulate because 
they bore an interest. That Massachusetts bay in the last war emitted 
50,000 in notes bearing an interest of 6 per cent which were immediately 
locked up and withdrawn from the circulation even tho' gold and silver 
was plentiful among them. That new emissions would only encrease the 
difficulty, that the continent would bear only 7 millions. That Unless 
the interest was raised, the money holder would employ his money in 
speculation in buying lands, and in monopolising goods, by which means 
the necessaries of life were enhanced in thier price. That this alone 
would regulate the price of goods, that no other wisdom [two lines torn 
out] 

emission he would rather see our army disbanded, and Howe let loose to 
ravage the whole country.^ 

Upon calling the question The States (10 in number) divided equally. 

As a proof of the impropriety of each state having a seperate Vote, it 
is remarkable that there were 18 members for raising the interest and 
10 only against it. The States that voted in favor of it were New-Ham- 
shire, Massachussettsbay, New Jersey, Pensylvania, and Virginia. The 
inhabitants of these states collectively make near two thirds of the whole 
inhabitants of the united States.*

Gentlemen 

I have it in Charge from Congress to Request that the State of Mary- 
land may be fully and constantly Represented in Congress, the Necessity 
of every State being fully Represented to Add weight to the Council of 
America, as well as to keep up that Union and good Correspondence so 
essential to our Country, will naturally Suggest the propriety of this Ap- 
plication, which I have no doubt you will immediately comply with, more 
especially as Business of the utmost moment is before Congress.* .... 

352. John Adams to James Warren.* 

Baltimore, 12 February, 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

The certificates and check-books for the loan-office I hope and presume 
are arrived in Boston before this time, and, notwithstanding the discourag- 
ing accounts which were given me when I was there, I still hope that a 
considerable sum of money will be obtained by their means. 

It is my private opinion, however, that the interest of four per cent, 
is not an equitable allowance. I mean that four per cent, is not so much 
as the use of the money is honestly worth in the ordinary course of busi- 
ness, upon an average for a year ; and I have accordingly exerted all the 
little faculties I had, in endeavoring, on Monday last, to raise the interest 
to six per cent. But after two days' debate, the question was lost by an 
equal division of the States present, five against five.* New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts Bay, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia on one side, 
and Rhode Island, Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Georgia, on the other. Here was an example of the inconvenience and 
injustice of voting by States. Nine gentlemen, representing about eight 
hundred thousand people, against eighteen gentlemen, representing a 
million and a half nearly, determined this point. Yet we must not be 
startled at this.'

I think it my duty to mention this to you, because it must be astonishing 
to most people in our State, that the interest is so low. I know they are 
at a loss to account for it upon any principles of equity or policy, and 
consequently may be disposed to blame their delegates; but you may 
depend upon it, they are not in fault. 

I tremble for the consequences of this determination. If the loan 
officers should not procure us money, we must emit more, which will 
depreciate all which is already abroad, and so raise the prices of provisions 
and all the necessaries of life, that the additional expense to the continent 
for supplying their army and navy will be vastly more than the two per 
cent, in dispute, besides all the injustice, chicanery, extortion, oppression, 
and discontent, which is always occasioned everywhere by a depreciating 
medium of trade. I am much afraid of another mischief. I fear that for 
want of wisdom to raise the interest in season, we shall be necessitated, 
within a few months to give eight or ten per cent., and not obtain the 
money we want after all. 

I have been so often a witness of the miseries of this after-wisdom, 
that I am wearied to death of it. 

Had a bounty of twenty dollars a man been offered soldiers last June, 
it would have procured more than the enormous bounties that are now 
offered will procure. Had government been assumed in the States twelve 
months sooner than it was, it might have been assumed with spirit, vigor, 
and decision, and would have obtained an habitual authority before the 
critical time came on, when the strongest nerves of government are 
necessary ; whereas now, every new government is as feeble as water, and 
as brittle as glass. 

Had we agreed upon a non-exportation, to commence when the non- 
importation commenced, what an immense sum should we have saved! 
Nay, very probably we should have occasioned a very different House of 
Commons to be chosen, the ministry to have been changed, and this war 
avoided. Thus it is. You, who will make no ill use of these observations, 
may read them, but the times are too delicate and critical to indulge freely 
and generally in such speculations. It is best, I believe, that no mention 
should be made that the rate of interest has been again debated, lest some 
saving men should withhold their money in hopes of compelling the public 
to raise the interest. If the interest should never be raised, those who lend 
in our State will fare as well as others ; if it should, the interest of all will 
be raised, that which is borrowed now as well as that which shall be 
borrowed hereafter. I sincerely wish that our people would lend their 
money freely. They will repent of it if they do not. We shall be com- 
pelled to emit such quantities that every man, except a few villains, will 
lose more by depreciation than the two per cent. Not to mention again 
the scene of anarchy and horror, that a continuation of emissions will 
infallibly bring upon us. 

The design of loan-offices was to prevent the farther depreciation of the 
bills by avoiding farther emissions. We might have emitted more bills 
promising an interest, but if those had been made a legal tender like the 

21 



2 

other bills, and, consequently mixed in the circulation with them, they 
would instantly have depreciated all the other hills four per cent., if the 
interest was four, and more than that, too, by increasing; the (juantity of 
circulating cash. In order to prevent these certificates from circulation, 
and consequently from depreciating the bills, we should give them such 
attributes as will induce men of fortune and others who usually lend 
money, to hoard them up. The persons who usually lend money are, 
I. Men of fortune, who live upon their income, and these generally choose 
to have a surplusage to lay up every year to increase their capitals. 2. 
Opulent merchants who have more money than they choose to risk, or can 
conveniently employ in trade. 3. Widows, whose dower is often converted 
into money and placed out at interest, that they may receive an annual 
income to live upon, without the care and skill which is necessary to 
employ money advantageously in business. 4. Orphans, whose guardians 
seldom incline to hazard the property of their wards in business. 5. A few 
divines, lawyers, and physicians, who are able to lay by a little of their 
annual earnings. 6. Here and there a farmer and a tradesman, who is 
forehanded and frugal enough to make more money than he has occasion 
to spend. Add to these, â€” 7. Schools, colleges, towns, parishes, and other 
societies, which sometimes let money. All these persons are much attached 
to their interest, and so anxious to make the most of it, that they compute 
and calculate it even to farthings and single days. These persons can get 
six per cent., generally, of private borrowers, on good security of mort- 
gages or sureties. 

Now. is it reasonable in the State to expect that monied men will lend 
to the public at a less interest than they can get from private persons ? 

I answer, yes, when the safety of the State is not in doubt, and when 
the medium of exchange has a stable value, because larger sums may be 
put together, and there is less trouble in collecting and receiving the 
interest, and the security is better. But the case is otherwise, when men 
are doubtful of the existence of the State, and it is worse still, when men 
see a prospect of depreciation in the medium of trade. All governments 
in distress are obliged to give a higher interest for money than when they 
are prosperous. 

The interest of money always bears some proportion to the profits of 
trade. When the commerce of a country is small, lodged in few hands, 
and very profitable, the interest of money is very high. Charles the Fifth 
was necessitated to give twenty-four per cent, for money; afterwards it 
fell in Europe to twelve, and since to six, five, four, and three. 

I think I shall never consent to go higher than six per cent., as much as 
I am an advocate for raising it to that, and in this I have been constant for 
full nine months. The burden of six per cent, upon the community will 
very soon be heavv^ enough. We must fall upon some other methods of 
ascertaining the capitals we borrow. A depreciating currency we must 
not have, it will ruin us. The medium of trade ought to be as unchange- 
able as truth, as immutable as morality. The least variation in its value 
does injustice to multitudes, and in proportion it injures the morals of 
the people, a point of the last importance in a republican government.

Thus far I had written a long- time ago, since which, after many days 
deHberation and debate, a vote passed for raising the interest to six per 
cent. If this measure should not procure us money, I know not what 
resource we shall explore.*

353. Thomas Burke, Abstract of Debates.^ 

Feh'y. 12th. Maryland and Pennsylvania were very solicitous to pro- 
cure a vote of Congress, approving a meeting lately held by committees 
appointed by the four New England Governments, to the end that this 
approbation might imply a right to disapprove. It occasioned very long 
and interesting debates. At length the general opinion was that Congress 
had necessarily a right to inquire into the cause of any meeting and to 
require to know what was transacted at any such meetings, and also to 
require an explanation of anything that was dubious, and satisfaction for 
anything that was alarming to the whole, or any one of the States ; that 
this right necessarily existed in their power to take care each for his 
respective State that no injury happened to her from without. But that 
Congress had no right to prohibit meetings, or censure them if the transac- 
tions in them were not injurious to others. The delegate of North 
Carolina refuse [d] to say what his State could not do, declaring he 
thought she could do every thing which she had not precluded herself 
from by plain and express declaration : to yield up any of her rights was 
not in his power, and very far from his inclination : that by the Law of 
Nations she had a right to demand a satisfactory account and explanation 
of any transaction of one or more States, and she had appointed him to 
watch lest any injury should come to her from without. In this he would 
use his best endeavours. The question put, the approbation was denied, 
many voting against it lest its ambiguity should create further disputes ; 
of this number was North Carolina.^

Upon the question whether the Congress should recommend to the 
States to adopt the plan for reducing and regulating the price of labor, 
Manufactures, imports, and provisions which had been adopted in the 
four new England States.^ 

It was said in the negative by Mr Jas Smith. That such a recommenda- 
tion would interfere with the domestic police of each State which were 
of too delicate a nature to be touched by the Congress. 

Dr Rush. I am against the whole of the resolution. It is founded in 
the contrary of justice, policy and necessity as has been declared in the 
resolution. The wisdom and power of goverment have been employed in 
all ages to regulate the price of necessaries to no purpose. It was 
attempted in Eng*^. in the reign of Edward II by the English parliament 
but without effect. The laws for limiting the price of every thing were 
repealed, and ]Mr Hume who mentions this fact records even the very 
attempt as a monument of human folly. The congress with all its 
authority have failed in a former instance of regulating the price of goods. 
You have limited Bohea tea to f of a dollar, and yet it is daily sold before 
your eyes for 30/. The Committee of Philadelphialimited the price of West 
India goods about a year ago. But what \vas the consequence? The 
merchents it is true sold their rum, sugar and molasses at the price limited 
by the committee, but they charged a heavy profit upon the barrel, or the 
paper which contained the rum or the sugar. Consider Sir the danger

of failing in this experiment. The Salvation of this continent depends 
upon the Authority of this congress being held as sacred as the cause of 
liberty itself. Suppose we should fail of producing the effects we wish 
for by the resolution before you. Have we any charecter to spare ? Have 
we committed no mistakes in the management of the public Affairs of 
America? We have Sir. It becomes us therefore to be careful of the 
remains of our Authority and charecter. It is a common thing to cry 
aloud of the rapacity and extortion in every branch of business etc. among 
every class of men. This has led some people to decry the public Virtue 
of this country. True Sir there is not so much of it as we could wish, 
but there is much more than is sometimes allowed on this floor. We 
estimate our Virtue by a false barometer when we measure it by the price 
of goods. The extortion we complain off arises only from the excessive 
quantity of our money. Now Sir a failure in this Attempt to regulate 
the price of goods will encrease the clamors against the rapacity of dealers, 
and thus depreciate our public virtue. Consider Sir the consequence of 
measuring our virtue by this false standard. You will add weight to the 
Arguments used at St James's to explode patriotism altogether, and by 
denying its existence in this country destroy it forever. Persuade a 
Woman that there is no such thing as chastity, and if there is that She 
does not possess it, and She may be easily seduced if She was as chaste as 
Diana. Sir, The price of goods may be compared to a number of light 
substances in a bason of water. The hand may keep them down for a while, 
but nothing can detain them on the bottom of the bason but an Abstrac- 
tion of the Water. The continent labours under a universal malady. 
From the crown of her head to the Soal of her feet She is full of disorders. 
She requires the most powerful tonic medicines. The resolution before 
you is Nothing but an Opiate. It may compose the continent tor a night, 
but She will soon awaken again to a fresh sense of her pain and misery. 

Col: Richd Henry Lee, in the affirmative. Mr President, The learned 
Doctor has mistook the disorder of the continent. She labours under a 
spasm, and Spasms he knows require palliative medicines. I look upon 
the resolution before you only as a temporary remedy. But it is absolutely 
necessary. It is true the regulations formerly recommended by Congress 
were not faithfully carried into execution, but this was owing to the want 
of regular governments. New and regular goverments have been insti- 
tuted in every part of America, and these will enable all classes of people 
to carry the resolutions into execution. 

Mr Saml Chase, in the Affirmative. Mr President This is a necessary 
resolution. It is true it failed formerly in Philadelphia because it abounded 
with tories. But it succeeded in Maryland. It must be done. The mines 
of Peru would not support a war at the present high price of the neces- 
saries of life, your Soldiers cannot live on their pay. It must be raised 
unless we limit the price of the cloathing and other articles necessary for 
them. 

Mr Seargant â€” Negative. The price of goods cannot be regulated while 
the quantity of our money and the articles of life are allowed to fluctuate. 



252 Cont'mcntal Congress 

This is and must be the case with us, therefore we cannot regulate the 
price of anything. 

Col James IVilson, Negative. Mr President, I differ from the gentle- 
man from Virginia about the possibility of carrying the resolution before 
you into execution. The modern goverments I am sure have not half the 
vigilance or authority that the conventions and committees formerly had, 
and yet these failed in this business. Connecticut where the influence of 
good laws prevail greatly, adopted this plan with diffidence. There are 
certain things Sir which Absolute power cannot do. The whole power 
of the Roman Emperors could not add a single letter to the Alphabet. 
Augustus could not compel old batchclors to marry. He found out his 
error, and wisely repealed his edict least he should bring his Authority 
into contempt. Let us recommend the resolution to the consideration of 
the States only without giving our Opinion on it, that they may discuss 
it with unbiassed minds. Foreign trade is absolutely necessary to enable 
us to carry on the war. This resolution will put an end to it, for it will 
hang as a dead weight upon all the operations of external commerce. 

Dr Witherspoon, negative. Sir, It is a wise maxim to avoid those 
things which our enemies wish us to practise. Now I find that our 
enemies have published the Act of the Asembly of Connecticut for regula- 
ting the price of necessaries in the New York paper in order to shew our 
distress from that Quarter. I believe the regulations would be just, if the 
quantity of money and the scarcity of goods bore an exact proportion to 
each Other. But the price of goods is by no means proportioned to the 
quantity of money in every thing. The encrease of price began ist upon 
the Luxuries 2ly Necessaries, 3rd Manufactories and 4ly grain, and Other 
produce of the earth. Now the reason why it has reached the grain etc 
last, is owing to thier quantity being plentiful and to an overproportion 
of money. Remember laws are not almighty. It is beyond the power of 
despotic princes to regulate the price of goods. Tea and Salt are higher 
in proportion than any Other Articles of trade owing entirely to thier 
price being limited. In Pensylvania salt was limited to 15/ but was sold 
for 60/ per bushel, w^hile at the same time it was sold in Virginia where 
there was no limitation for 10/ a bushel. I fear if we fail in this measure 
we shall weaken the Authority of Congress. We shall do mischief by 
teaching the continent to rest upon it. If we limit one article, we must 
limit every thing, and this is impossible. 

Mr John Adams, Negative. Perhaps I may here speak agst. the sense 
of my constitutents, but I cannot help it, I much doubt the justice, policy 
and necessity of the resolution. Its policy and necessity depend upon its 
practicability, and if it is practicable, I beleive it \\\\\ be unjust. It amounts 
to the same as raising the value of your money to double its present value 
and this experiment was tried in vain even in the absolute goverment of 
France. The high price of many Articles arises from their scarcity. If 
we regulate the price of imports we shall immediately put to \_sic\ stop 
to them for ever. 

Dr Rush. Sir, It has been said that the high price of goods in Philadelphia 
arose from the monoplies, and extortion of the tories. Here I must say 



February, lyyy 253 

the tories are blamed without cause. A similar Spirit of Speculation pre- 
vails among the Whigs in Philadelphia They are disposed to realise thier 
money in lands, or goods, But this is not owing to any timidity or disaf- 
fection among them. They fear the further depreciation of your money 
by future emissions. Stop your emissions of money and you will stop 
Speculation, and fill your treasury from the loan Offices. I beg leave to 
inform Congress that the committee of Philadelphia was supported by the 
country people in thier Attempt to regulate the price of West India goods, 
but were notwithstanding unsuccessful. Now Sir, the country people are 
equally concerned with the merchants in keeping Up the price of every 
thing, and in eluding laws for reducing them. I am not apt to reply to 
words much less to play upon them. The gentleman from Virginia has 
miscalled the malady of the continent. It is not a spasm, but a dropsy. 
I beg leave to prescribe two remedies for it. i Raising the interest of the 
money we borrow to 6 per cent, this like a cold bath will give an immediate 
Spring to our affairs â€” and 2 taxation. This like tapping, will diminish 
the Quantity of our Money, and give a proper value to what remains. 

The resolution was amended. The plan of the 4 New England States 
w^as referred only to the Other States, to act as they tho't proper.' 

356. Thomas Burke, Abstract of Debates.^ 

Feb. 15th. Yesterday was consumed in desultory debates upon a report 
of a special committee upon the proceedings of the four New England 
Governments above mentioned, and it was recommitted.^ This day it was 
brought in under a form agreeable to what was the sense of the House on 
what was yesterday considered. At first it expressed the opinion of Con- 
gress, that the proceedings were founded in justice, policy and necessity, 
and merited the warmest approbation. The second declared neither appro- 
bation or opinion, except particularly relating to the New England 
Governments, because of their peculiar circumstances, but proposed laying 
it before the other States for their imitation if they thought proper, avoid- 
ing as much as possible any expression that might suggest to the States 
that Congress approved or disapproved. In this form it passed without 
a negative, and it w-as voted that several States should be advised to confer 
with each other on this subject : viz : New York, New Jersey, Pennsyl- 
vania, Maryland and Virginia : North Carolina, South Carolina and 
Georgia. Nothing very remarkable happened in this debate except that 
Virginia insisted on being connected with Maryland, and refused to be 
connected with the Southern States. The delegates present from Virginia 
w^ere Richard Henry Lee, Francis Lightfoot Lee and Man. Page, all 
residing on Rapahanock and Potomack rivers. The Delegate from 
North Carolina represented that great part of the exportation of North 
Carolina was through Virginia, that her market was therefore in that 
State, and that she ought undoubtedly to be consulted in regulating the

prices since she was so much interested therein that it was unjust and 
ungenerous in \'irj^inia to endeavmir to rci,uilate them without her, and 
evidently shewed she was wilhnj;- to do what wouhl affect the interest of 
North Carolina without her knowledge or consent. Virginia persisted, 
and the vote passed for her conferring with Maryland etc. The question 
was now proposed for the conference of the Southern States; the Dele- 
gates opposed it, alledging that their articles of exportation would be 
always very low, by reason of the danger and difficulty of exporting; 
that none had provisions to spare but North Carolina, and her market for 
them being chiefly to Virginia she was precluded from regulation in that 
article by the regulation made in Virginia, of which as she would have no 
notice she could not accomodate herself thereto, and her Delegate declared 
she had too much vigilance and sagacity to make regulation since it might 
preclude her from taking advantage of circumstances to defend herself 
from the injustice of her neighbor Virginia; that since Virginia chose to 
confer with other States in making regulations which might affect North 
Carolina, and refused to confer with her where her interest was so nearly 
concerned, Virginia was entitled to no attention from North Carolina, 
and she ought to have it in the power of her citizens to avail themselves 
of all advantages which circumstances might throw in their way. The 
question put â€” all voted for the conference of the Southern States except 
their own Delegates.* R. H, Lee privately told the Delegate from North 
Carolina that he need not be disturbed on this occasion, because Virginia 
could make no regulation but what must affect herself. The Delegate 
replied that it was arrogantly assuming to judge of her affairs, and affect 
them without her consent ; it was taking advantage of her situation to be 
arbiter of the commerce of North Carolina, and it was shewing an entire 
disregard to her interest and circumstances, and having them entirely to 
depend on the decisions of the Northern States, without even being con- 
sulted. The Delegate declared he thought this such an instance of con- 
tempt and disregard in Virginia, that he could not but receive it with 
indignation.*

Purpose, and mean't when the States should borrow Money to emit it at 
five pr. Cent., thinking that there was the Difference of One pr. Cent 
between continental and colonial Security. As there may possibly be a 
Question about Increase of Interest hereafter I should be glad to be 
informed how high the Assembly thinks it would be proper for Congress 
to go in Order to answer their Purpose of collecting Continental Dollars 
by Loan-OfTfice Certificates in our States ; for by their Sentiments I mean 
to be governed. At present it stands at Four per Cent, and I hope that an 
Increase of Interest will never become necessary ; for thereby the Public 
Debt would be enhanced. Its continuing at four per Cent, depends greatly 
upon the Encouragement that the Assemblies of the Several States shall 
give to the Loan Office. Our State will I dont doubt pay as they have ever 
done a due Regard to the Resolutions of Congress ; for it is her Interest 
to stand well with the superintending Power of these States.^ Congress 
have taken into Consideration the Doings of the Committee of the New- 
England States, and have approved of the Measures taken for the Defence 
of the State You govern, of the Regulation of the Prices of Articles of 
Produce etc., and have recommended it to the other States in the Union 
to take such Measures for regulating and fixing the Price of Provisions 
etc as they may think expedient ; they approved also of the Embargo ; but 
disapprove of the Emission of Paper Money by the States. This is, as 
well as I can recollect, the Substance of the Resolves, for they past this 
Day and I have not been able to get a Copy of them. They will be pub- 
lished ; but as I know it will give the State great Pleasure to be assured 
that Congress approve of the Measures taken for its Defence, as that 
Approbation involves in it the Idea of pa5ang the Expence thereof, I can- 
not forbear giving you the earliest Intelligence of it.' 

A Question of considerable Importance was started on considering the 
Doings of the Committee. A Resolve was moved for in some such Form 
as this, â€” Resolved that as the Communication between Congress and the 
New-England States was interrupted, and the State of Rhode-Island v/as 
threatend with an Invasion or actually invaded Congress considering the 
Necessity of their taking Measures for their Defence approve of their 
Meeting etc. The Advocates for the Motion went upon this Principle 
that none of the United States have a Right to meet without the prior or 
subsequent Approbation of Congress; those that took the other Side of 
the Question asserted that any Two or more of the States have a Right 
to meet for the Purpose of consulting upon Matters relative to themselves ; 
and after a long metaphysical Debate which took up Part of three Days 
Congress were equally divided. All the Members agreed that the meeting 
was right considering the Circumstances; but split upon the Question of 
Right hinted at.*

358. William Hooper to Joseph Hewes.' 

Halifax Monday February 15. 1777 
Dear Joseph 

Here I arrived late yesterday after a most fatiguing Journey all the 
way on Horseback from Baltimore hither. An unremitting attendance 
upon congress all day and uj)on committees on Evenings during the 
solitary representation of North Carolina by degrees impaired my accus- 
tomed stock of health and at length brought on a fever which for several 
days bafHed the skill of Doctor Wirzenthall and the power of medicine. 
It had a crisis which proved fortunate, I took the advantage of an Inter- 
mission and resumed my seat in Congress â€” a Relapse was the Conse- 
quence and I had very nearly measured my length under Ground in that 
worst of all terrestrial places, a situation bad as it is yet preferable to 
being above it long in that wretched place. I have not yet recovered. I 
was broiling in a fever all last night and I can scarce muster strength to 
get on Horseback tho I propose to go on this day.^ 

Burke came to my relief on Saturday the first day of February and 
your express delivered me your packet about two hours before Burke 
appeared. Your Express with the fatigue of his Journey and from other 
causes found himself much indisposed and from this and his apprehension 
of the Small pox was averse to proceeding to Philadelphia. Fortunately, 
the next morning two congress expresses set ofT one for Philadelphia to 
return the next Saturday â€” the other for Boston to return as soon as might 
be. Your letters for Philad. I gave to the former and wrote R Morris 
,who was there and your Brother to dispatch answers by the return 
Express under Cover to Mr Hancock for you. Your Letter to the Gover- 
nour of Mass'"* went by the Boston express. I gave directions to Mush- 
raw to call upon Mr Hancock on Saturday for any letters which might 
come to him for you and if they were not arrived to wait till they did and 
then proceed immediately to Edenton. I apprized Mr Hancock of this 
measure so that no mistake can occur in the Conduct of it. Your Letter 
to the President etc. were layed before Congress, a Committee at my 
request appointed, and by Mushraw or soon afterwards in a letter by 
Burke you will know the Result.^ ....

359. Thomas Burke to the Governor of North Carolina/ 

Baltimore Feb'y. ioth.[i6?] 1777.- 
Sir: 

my last to you was by Mr. Hooper, and I suppose you have received it 
long before this.' I then announced my intention of troubling you every 
post, and I now sit down in order to perform, in some part, my promise. 

Of the political principle [s] of the respective States I am not yet able to 
speak very clearly, for they are kept as much as possible out of view. I 
conjecture, however, that all are under some apprehensions of combina- 
tion in the Eastern States to derive to themselves every possible advantage 
from the present war, at the expense of the rest. I am not yet satisfied 
that there is any combination amongst them. I rather think that they only 
combine when they have one common interest, which is seldom the case, 
and I am sure this is not peculiar to them. On some late questions I 
observed they divided ; one was relative to the interest to be paid on loans, 
another relative to the meeting of several States. In the sequel of this 
letter I mean to give you an abstract of the debates on these questions, 
and therefore shall say no more of them here. But, sir, I am more con- 
cerned to find that Pennsylvania, Alaryland, Jersey and some others are 
exceedingly jealous of the states whose bounds to the westward are yet 
unascertained, and I am much mistaken if they do not upon all occasions 
endeavour to fix very extensive power in a mere majority of Congress in 
order to get resolutions unfavorable to the claims of such states entered 
into. To be more explicit, I believe they will endeavour by degrees to 
make the authority of Congress very extensive, and when it shall be fully 
established and acknowledged, to make such a party in it as will pass 
resolves injurious to the rights of those states who claim to the South Seas. 
You will see by some matters in the abstract of debate which I shall sub- 
join that this conjecture is not quite void of foundation.* I am clearly 
of opinion at all events that those states who, like ours, have such claims 
should be explicit in declaring they will give no power to their Delegates 
to bind them in any thing that regards their Bounds. I am not yet able 
to be particular with respect to the measures intended to be pursued. We 
are endeavouring to forward, by every expedient, the recruiting service, 
and also the putting our Frigates to sea. Our greatest difficulty is in 
supplying the Treasury. This requires the nicest management. If we 
go on emitting money the quantity in circulation so enhances the prices 
of things that we shall only make money without being able to get for 
it more commodities, and it will, of course, destroy its own purpose. The 
Loan Office is at length considered as little better than new emissions, and 
a Tax seems the only adequate expedient. There is a plan under consider-

ation for this purpose; when it shall be deteriiiined I will be more explicit.* 
You will receive from the President a copy of some transactions in the 
New Eng^Iand Governments together with the Resolutions of Congress 
relative thereto. You will perceive that the intention of sending them 
to the difTerent states is to suggest to them to fall on methods something 
similar if they see it proper and necessary. Tho' no States are more in 
need of such regulations than where the armies march through, yet they 
opposed it, under the pretence that regulating prices would be imprac- 
ticable; but a majority of Congress were of opinion that it might be 
rendered so far effectual as to prevent engrossers and forestallers, and 
speculators, who purchased in hopes of a rising price, and thereby rendered 
necessary articles very scarce and difificult to be obtained. For my 
thoughts on the subject, I will refer you to the abstract of debates, that 
is so far as regards our own State. I indeed have no great opinion of an 
attempt to regulate prices in a country where the holders are under no 
necessity of selling; but knowing our own State was not much interested 
in this business I voted for it. in order to damp the practice of speculative 
monopoly which prevails in all the Northern States. You will see in the 
abstract my reasons for not approving it in ours.* I really feel myself 
much displeased at the disregard Virginia showed to our interest in the 
matter, and I believe, were I a member of your Assembly I should move 
that she might be desired to avow or disavow the conduct of her Delegates 
in Congress. But this I need not urge to you who are so good a judge of 
her interest, so jealous of her honour, and so careful to maintain her 
rights." 

We have just received some very agreeable intelligence from the army, 
but I expect it will be in the paper before I can close this letter. If not I 
will procure abstracts and enclose them to you. There are some Tory 
disturbances on the Eastern shore of this State, and the Civil Power do 
not seem to proceed with sufficient vigour against them. There [were] 
some Troops however sent against them, and I suppose my next will 
contain something final relative to them. I take abstracts of all the impor- 
tant debates in Congress, principally with a view of transmitting to you. 
I think i-t right that my country should know how I give her voice, and 
upon what principles I determined for her. If I am right her approbation 
will not only determine me, but others also, to proceed with firmness. 
If I am mistaken she, only, can correct me, and by correcting me inform 
others more fully of their duty. I doubt not the candor of my country- 
men, they will believe I act for them to the best of my judgment, and 
when that judgment errs I am desirous it should be better instructed by 
them, or if they find it defective, and unfit for their service, 'tis surely 
right they should have an opportunity of substituting a better in so impor- 
tant a trust. The intelligence above mentioned is in the paper; it is that

Baltimore 18 Febry. 1777 
Dear Sir 

I have repeatedly wrote pressing letters backed by resolves of Congress 
for a full representation of our State.' but have as yet not been honoured 
with an answer. Permit me still to remind you that in my opinion our 
State may suffer for the want thereof, for Instance, the General has 
recommended to Congress the promotion of three Majors Generals from 
Brigadiers, and Ten Brigadiers from Colonels, and has given in a list of 
some persons as a hint to Congress ; the mode and persons has occasion'd 
many days debate, and is this day to be brought on again, and notwith- 
standing many declarations to the contrary, Colonial prejudices sway the 
minds of individuals, that each state appear interested in the debates, for 
promotion in the line of their respective State [s]^ from this Sir you may 
judge how the State of New York is circumstanced, having no vote in this, 
and many other weighty points, and which I hope the Honble Convention 
will speedily rectify 

I am also to informe you that Congress have appointed the 25th. Instant 
for the day on which they will adjourn to the City of Philadelphia,* so that 
the Delegates you shall send to Congress may meet them there.

Feb. 1 2th to 19th 1777. 

Several days of this week were consumed in debates on the appointment 
of General Officers.^ The debates were perplexed, inconclusive and irk- 
some. The Delegates of several States were desirous of fixing a rule of 
promotion, and several were offered and rejected. Maryland, Virginia, 
and North Carolina desired that each State should recommend officers in 
proportion to the men they furnish : three Battalions, one Brigadier, nine 
[battalions], one Major General. This was rejected. It was then pro- 
posed to promote General Officers as they stood in rank, and rejected. To 
all the rules a saving was added, that the Congress might deviate 
from any, in favour of merit eminently distinguished and generally 
acknowledged. 

North Carolina argued that some rule should be observed, and entered 
on the Journals. That the Congress would be an object of very jealous

api)rchcnsion, unchecked and unlimited as it is, if the officers of the army 
hekl their honor at the precarious pleasure of a majority. Officers hold 
their honor the most dear of anything. Setting them aside when they 
were entitled to promotion would wound that honor very sorely. Their 
attention would therefore he entirely to that authority which had so much 
power to wound it, or to cherish it. This policy was always ohserved by 
monarchs, and the end was to keep the army dependent on them : but 
such policy was unbecoming^ in Congress, who ought to give no room for 
jealousy. The rule of succession is most familiar to officers, and there- 
fore most agreeable to them ; but the proportion would give greatest 
satisfaction to the States, and the satisfying them was of greatest impor- 
tance and ought to be adopted. 

At length it was proposed to resolve, that regard be had to the rank, to 
the quota, and to merit. It was agreed to, but no notice was taken of it 
in the nomination or appointments. N, Carolina did not vote for Major 
Generals ; because the delegate found, no rule was observed, and he knew 
nothing of the merit of any officers in nomination, and did not choose to 
give a vote in Congress, for which he could give no reason.

Dr Rush 

I have heard the congress more than once called a republic. I love to 
realize the idea, and I hope it will inspire us with the virtuous principles 
of republican goverments. One of the most powerful and happy com- 
monwealths in the world Rome called her general officers from the plough 
and paid no regard to rank, service or seniority. We have of late been 
successful it is true, but I despair of our country being saved 'till the 
instrumentality of military wisdom and virtue are employed for that 
purpose, and these can never be had 'till we use a soverign power in calling 
them forth where ever we find them. It is to no purpose to talk of the 
practice of despotic princes. They promote acording to seniority it is 
true, but they possess an absolute power of recalling, disgracing, or break- 
ing their general Officers as soon as they make them, and we find they 
are fond of exerc[is]ing this pow^r upon the least neglect, inattention, or 
want of Success. The case is different with us. A general may loose a 
battle or a province, and we possess no power to recall or to displace him. 
If the motion is passed I shall move immediately afterwards that all the 
civil power of the continent may be transferred from our hands into the 
hands of the army, and that they may be proclaimed the highest power 
of the people.

Mr President, I am against the motion. It will produce faction, and 
disputes among your generals. I once left the honors of the college over 
which I preside to the choice of the senior class, But it produced so much 
confusion and ill blood, that I was obliged to resume that power again, 
and have since excercised to the satisfaction of my pupils as well as my 
own.

I wish the learned Doctor would distinguish between the practice of

and would not be governed by the principles which actuate boys at schools.

Mr President, I differ from the gentleman who spoke last. There are 
certain principles which follow us thro' life, and none more certainly than 
the love of the Urst place. We see it in the forms on which Children sit 
at Schools. It prevails equally to the last period of life. I am sorry to 
find it prevails so little in this Assembly. I have been distressed to see 
some members of this house disposed to idolise an image which thier 
own hands have molten. I speak here of the superstitious veneration that 
is sometimes paid to Genl Washington. Altho' I honour him for his good 
qualities, yet in this house I feel myself his Superior. In private life I 
shall always acknowledge that he is mine.' It becomes us to attend early 
to the restraining our army. This we shall find the next difficult thing to 
prevent : the depreciation of our money. I have no fears from the resig- 
nation of Officers if junior Officers are preferred to them. If they have 
virtue they will continue with us. If not, thier resignation will not 
hurt us.*

[February 20, 1777.] 

Congress received a letter Feby 20th 1777 from Genl Lee a prisoner in 
New York (written by permission of Lord and general Howe) requesting 
a conference with two or three members of congress upon matters of the 
last importance to himself, and his opinion to Ameri[c]a. upon which it 
was said by 

Dr Rush. 

Mr President, In considering of the propriety of this request it becomes 
us I to attend to the present situation of the Court of Britain, 2ly to the 
conduct and charecters of Lord and general Howe, and 3 to the conduct, 
and charrecter of general Lee. i The court of Britain is alarmed with 
the fear of a french war. They wish to terminate the present war in 
america by a negociation as well as by the sword. They have no terms to

offer us. They mean only to deceive and divide us. 2 Lord and genl 
Howe were chosen as fit instruments for seducing and deceivinj.,' the col- 
onies. Tlicy have practi.sed many Arts for that purpose. Witness the 
conference they extorted from the conj^^ress thro' Genl Sullivan last 
summer. They have been told by the reinforcement of tories that lately 
joined them its effect upon the people of America, and they expect thro' a 
better instrument (Genl Lee) to produce greater and worse effects by a 
conference with the members of congress set on foot at their request by 
the general. 3 General Lee with all his great qualities possesses the 
weakness of being easily imposed upon. His charecters of men are dic- 
tated by caprice or passion. I have seldom known him give a true 
charecter of any man. He is fond of negociations and conferences. He 
tried to bring about an interview with Genl Burgoyne at Cambridge for 
that purpose. He urged a second interview with Lord Howe last summer. 
I beleive Genl Lee to be honest and sincerely attached to our cause, but 
some people suppose he threw himself in the way of being taken prisoner. 
Considering all these things I maintain that a compliance with the general 
request would be impolitic, and highly dangerous to the union and safety 
of the united States. 

Mr. Jno Adams. 

Mr President, I am against the proposed conference. It will do mis- 
chief. The last conference wnth Lord Howe did no good. The Whigs 
were alarmed with it, and the tories complained that the reason why it 
did not end in a negociation was because improper men were sent, and 
because the congress did not relax eno' from its dignity. I admire Genl 
Lee for his military talents, but he possesses an unbounded Share of 
Vanity. This Vanity led him to correspond with Genl Burgoyne, and 
induced him to propose himself as one of a committee to confer with Lord 
Howe. His Lordship has no terms to offer us. The kings Speech is 
decisive against us. It lets loose all the dogs of war and corruption upon 
us, But it carries a remedy to its terrors along with it. it holds out the 
probability of a war w'th. France. 

Mr Chase. 

I am against the conference, but I move for the publication of Genl 
Lee's letter to the congress in order to satisfy our constituents who have 
heard that it contains propositions of peace. 

Mr. Mid die ton. 

I am against the conference for the reasons that have been given. 
Lord Howe has made use of Genl. Lee as a decoy duck to take in the 
colonies. I am against the publication of the General ['s] letter to the 
congress. Unless you publish with it his letter to Genl Washington in 
which he requests the company of his Aiddecamp and his dogs. 

Col Harrison. 

I suspect Lord and General Howe have offered Genl Lee his life on 
condition of his bringing About this conference which is designed to

betray us into a negociation. It will suspend our military Operations, 
and injure us in the court of France where our commissioners are now 
soliciting an Alliance for us. The last conference wth Lord Howe had 
this effect.^ Let us suppose that he means only to confer with us about 
his private affairs, and let us pass a resolution declaring our determination 
to support him and our willingness to hear and transact any thing that 
related to his safety or interest. 

This resolution was unanimously agreed to.^

Feh'y. 20th A Committee on a letter from General Howe to General 
Washington reported,^ that five Hessian Field Officers, and a Col. Camp- 
bell ^ should be confined in order for retaliation, and that they should have 
copies of the resolutions and letters relative to this matter, in order to 
manifest the reluctance of Congress to this severity; which became 
necessary, being the only means whereby they could teach their enemies 
to regard the Law of Nations and the rights of humanity. Some severe 
epithets were prefixed to enemies in the report, and they were objected to 
as unbecoming the dignity of Congress. A debate ensued in which some 
Gentlemen pointed out the impropriety of a bold figurative style in public 
Instruments, and the beauty and propriety of simplicity. R. H. Lee, of 
Virginia (as usual) insisted strongly on retaining the epithets, because 
they expressed only what our enemies really are, and urged that the best 
writers always used such terms on the like occassions. The Delegate from 
North Carolina observed that simplicity of style was true beauty, and 
dignity, in the language of public bodies. Embellishments of splendid 
epithets and figures, if proper at all, w^ere only for rhetoricians and such 
as write for amusement, that he could wish our Energy might appear in 
our Actions, and that our Language might be simple and unadorned, he

Freedom were as remarkable for Modesty in their Languap^e, as for Vigor 
in their Exertions, that he wished the Congress would Imitate them in 
both, on the Question the Exceptionable passage was exi)unged. the 
Debate now turned on the Question whether the Law of Nations was 
proper to be mentioned. Some Gentlemen Argued that it was improper 
to apply it to the proceedings against General Lee because they proposed 
trying him by the Laws of liis own Country, but others Insisted that they 
had no power to try him more than any other Prisoner by those Laws, 
many Distinctions were attempted which I did not understand, at length 
the North Carolina Delegate declared he thought all Laws were to be 
laid aside but what both Parties were subject to in Common, these were 
only the Laws of Nature and Nations, the Municipal Laws of all Coun- 
tries at War were silent with respect to the mere Transaction that relates 
to. or were the Consequence of War. That it was the proper Policy of 
Britain still to regard the Americans as subjects and to Insist on the 
Execution of the Municipal Laws, but it was the proper policy of America 
to maintai[n] that the American States stand in no other reIat[ion] 
[to] Britain than as an Independant Empire * at War with her, and there- 
fore that the Law of Nations alone ought to be observed betvveen them, 
that retalliation is the only Instrument whereby Nations can Compell the 
observance of that Law. and America ought therefore firmly to retalliate 
when the Law of Nations was Violated, the Question was carried in 
favor of the Insertion of the Law of Nations.

In Consequence of the Proceedings of the several Committees from the 
States of Massachusetts Bay Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode 
Island being laid before Congress, they have come to the enclosed Resolves, 
which I am commanded to transmit to you. together with those Parts of 
the Minutes that relate to the Price of Labour and other articles. 

Altho Congress approve the Measures adopted by the Body to prevent 
the Depreciation of their Currency, (except striking Bills to bear Interest) 
yet they have referred to the Consideration of the other States the Pro- 
priety of regulating the Prices of Goods, and at the same Time recommend 
to them to devise such Expedients as they may think will be most likely 
to remedy the Evils occasioned by the exorbitant Prices of Manufactures 
and all other Articles of Trade. I am therefore to request you will 
appoint Commissioners to meet at York Town in Pennsylvania on the 
third Monday in March next then and there to confer with other Com-

Gentlemen. 

I am sorry to inform you that the Report of the Engagement on Fryday 
Week is without any other Foundation than a little Skirmish, which the 
General barely mentions in his Letter to our Committee in Philadelphia.^ 

Congress are anxiously expecting a Reinforcement to our brave and 
worthy General from the new Levies, above Six weeks ago Congress 
directed General Smallwood to take a tour thro the State, and exert his 
Influence in raising our Quota, and they called on all our public Bodies, 
and every Friend to America, to yield him their Assistance.^ I mention 
this because Congress flattered themselves with great Success from this 
Measure and it is said it has been neglected. 

A little attention to our public Affairs, and the State of our Army will 
convince any Man that the most vigorous Exertions are necessary and 
must be adopted to procure our Quota. I shall not enlarge on this impor- 
tant subject. I beg leave to call your immediate attention to it, and if a 
Moment's delay can be granted, be pleased to consider the following 
Extract of a letter from Genl. Washington to his friend Colo. Harrison, 
of 12 Instant. " with great Truth I can add, that Heaven alone knows 
upon what principle they (the enemy) act, or by what means, they are 
kept quiet. That we are not able to make the least stand, if they move, 
is as clear as the Sun in its Meridian Brightness. Whilst you are at an 
expence equal to the maintenance of a large army and expect that we are 
very strong, we have scarce men enough to mount the Common Guard " 

2 The letter to North Carolina reads : "' to meet at Charlestown in South 
Carolina, on the first Monday in May next then and there to confer with other Com- 
missioners from the States of South CaroHna and Georgia ". A variant form was sent to 
the New England States. See nos. 323, 326, 334, 336, 340, 347, 353, 355, 356, 357, 359,

We must aim at a radical Cure. The success of our Camp appears to me

of no less, in his opinion to the public, his letter was in very pressing 
Terms. It was the General Sense of Congress that no Conference ought 
to be held with any but Embassadors properly authorised by the Court 
of Britain to treat of Peace That Lord and General How could have no 
Powers on such a subject by Virtue of their Commissions which was par- 
ticularly Limitted by Parliament to other Purposes. That any Conference

Britain and by this means suspend for sometime their Intention of 
befriending us. but it was also agreed that the C[ong]ress ought to give 
every possible attention to Genera [1] Lee's personal Safety, the Difficulty 
was in the mode, Some being of opinion it ought to be by permitting any 
person he pleased to go and Confer with him on any matter relative to 
his private Business, others that it ought to be by ordering the General 
to send an Officer for that purpose.* at length the Congress came to a 
resolution to Direct General Washington to Inform General Lee of the 
Measures they were taking for his safety, and to request him to inform 
them of any thing which they could farther do, but that they could not 
think it Consistant with the Dignity of Congress to send a Committee to 
Treat with him on any public Business.*

Putnam, Spencer, Heath, are thought by very few to be capable of the 
great commands they hold. We hear of none of their heroic deeds of

Dear Sir 

The question for raising the interest of our loan office tickets to 6 per 
cent, was attempted again the day before yesterday in Congress but was 
lost as formerly by a division of the States. Every post and express that 
arrives brings us complaints of the want of money, and asurances of the 
impossibility of getting it as the low interest of 4 per cent. These com- 
plaints are echoed daily from every corner of the room but to no purpose. 
The States that oppose the raising of the interest are Rhode Island, Con- 
necticut, North and South Carolinas, and Georgia. Maryland is divided. 
It is worthy of notice here that only seven members of the congress who 
represent five of the above States decided the above question, contrary to 
the inclinations of not less than 17 members who represented the States 
that voted for raising the interest, and who represent at least jrds of 
the people of America.* This unjust mode of representation I hope will 
be altered in the confederation. If it is not it will end sooner or later in 
the ruin of the Continent. We shall attempt the important question once 
more before we adjourn to Philadelphia If we fail we are undone. Another 
emission of money will in my opinion be a public fraud which no State- 
necessity can justify. The loss of two or three provinces would not hurt 
our cause half so much as the news of our bankruptcy. 

The Congress have concluded unanimously not to send a deputation 
of their body to General Lee. The present distracted situation of the 
Court of Britain, the characters and conduct of Lord and General Howe, 
and the disposition which Genl. Lee always shew^ed for negociations, and

conferences with the General Officers belonging to the british Army 
induced the Congress readily to adopt a suspicion that the royal Commis- 
sioners had suggested the maneuvre in order to suspend our military 
operations, and to divide and deceive the States. This suspicion was 
rendered the more probable from the circumstances of this, being about 
the time in which our Commissioners at the Court of France will urge the 
necessity of a speedy declaration in our favor, and which can only be pre- 
vented by the news that we are negociating with Great Britain. It is well 
known the conference with Lord Howe last summer had well nigh ruined 
our interest at the Court of France. The Congress have passed a resolu- 
tion that will we hope satisfy the General that while we are jealous of our 
honor, we are determined to neglect nothing that concerns his safety, or 
private affairs.* 

We have yesterday appointed Colonels Poor, Glover, Patterson, Var- 
num, Wayne, Dehaes, Muhlenberg, Weedon, Jno. Cadwallider and Wood- 
ford Brigadiers General. Lord Sterling, with Messrs Mifflin, Sinclair,* 
Steven and Lincoln are Majors General.

of a company will backward the enlistment to complete it. I hope proper 
care will be taken to send good surgeons as much depends on them. 
Morgan and Stringer are both displaced, and the Medical Department 
will be put on a very different footing from what it was last Campaign 
You are sensible of the necessity of a reformation perticularly in that

Council of Safety and after communicating to them the intelligence con- 
tained in your Excellencys letters to Genl Gates and that to Congress ' 
We requested them to give immediate orders for putting all their Forces 
by Water into the best posture they possibly can, we also advised their 
collecting such of the Militia as have not been in actual service into such 
readiness, as to be subject to immediate orders, this can be done without 
giving any alarm, or at least any general alarm. Genl Gates will station 
proper Ofificers at New Town and give orders respecting the Boats on the 
Jersey side of Delaware, the present Cold Weather had made so much 
Ice in the Rivers and Creeks that they cannot be brought over, therefore 
if any sudden movements of the Enemy make it necessary, they must all 
be destroyed. We read with much concern one paragraph in your Excel- 
lencys letter to Genl. Gates relative to the removal of the Public Stores, 
in which you are pleased to cast a blame, that we do not deserve every 
requisition and recommendation of yours has been strictly and instantly 
attended to by this Committee, we have complyed with your wishes in

requested to reinforce General W^ashington with Militia from each.* 

To this Report of the Committee of the whole was subjoined a Declara- 
tion of Congress that it was their Intention to reinforce the General so 
as to enable him not only to Curb and Confine the Enemy within their 
present Quarters but with the Blessing of God Entirely to subdue them 
before they are reinforced. This pompous Paragraph was very much 
Condemned by some Gentlemen as an unworthy Gasconade, and it was 
warmly debated. North Caroli[na] observed that Threats were unbecom-

Feb'y 2^. This day there was a very interesting debate on some 
amendments proposed to a report of a Committee, appointed to consider 
of some means for preventing desertion ; - but the main question was con- 
cerning the jurisdiction of Congress and the States. The decision was 
postponed. The debate lay chiefly between Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, 
and the Delegate from North Carolina. The opinion of a great majority 
was with the latter; but it was not deemed prudent to decide. N. B. This 
is all that I can now transmit: but as you know the opinion of your 
Delegate on such questions, you can judge the opinion of Congress; and 
for this reason it is that I mention that a majority was in his favour.

Fehy 25th. The Question of Interest was again debated, and post- 
poned ^ A Report was taken up relative to Deserters.^ it stood Orig- 
inally a recommendation of Congress to the several states to Enact Laws 
Empowering all Constables Ferry keepers and Freeholders to take up 
persons suspected of being Deserters and carry them before any Justice 
of the Peace. An Amendment was moved the purport of which was that 
the Power should go Immediately from Congress â€” without the Interven- 

s The statement concerning the " pompous paragraph ", as given in N. C. State 
Records, might be construed to mean that the declaration was passed and then expunged. 
The account here given indicates that the declaration was in the report of the committee 
of the whole, but was rejected by Congress on a final vote. The votes for retaining the 
paragraph are explicitly mentioned as those of the " four Eastern States, Virginia, and 
Georgia". The absence of Maryland is not mentioned.

Dickinson Sergeant, Abraham Clark, and Jonathan Elmer. Stockton had been taken 
prisoner by the British and did not return to Congress (see no. 347, ante), and Elmer 
had obtained leave of absence Feb. 14. Only Witherspoon, Sergeant, and Clark therefore 
were present at this time. Sergeant's known hostility to Washington suggests him as the 
member alluded to by Burke. See however no. 347, ante.

tion of the states, many Gentlemen were inattentive and it passed. The 
Delepfate from North Carohna desired to bo infonned if he niijj^ht enter 
his Protest ajjainst it. he was informed by the cliair that he could not. he 
then desired to have his dissent entered on the Journal, declaring^ he was 
not Apprehensive of any Injury from it in the state he represented because 
he knew it would never be there observed the People too well knowing 
the Maxims of their Government, but that as it was as much as his Life 
was worth to consent to the Congress exercising such a Power, he desired 
that he might be able to prove from the Journals that he did not. he 
said it appeared to him that Congress was herein assuming a Power to give 
authority from themselves to persons within the States to sieze ard 
Imprison the persons of the citizens and thereby to endanger the person 1 
Liberty of every man in America. A motion was now made for recon- 
sidering, on the reconsideration the Debate lay chiefly between Mr. 
Wilson of Pensylvania, and the North Carolina Delegate Mr. Wilson 
argued that every object of Continental Concern was the subject of Con- 
tinental Councils, that all Provisions made by the Continental Councils 
must be carried into execution by Continental authority. That the Army 
was certainly a Continental object, and preventing Desertion in it was 
certainly as Necessary an object as the raising of it, that nothing could 
be more Necessary to prevent Desertion than to take Effectual Measures 
for Apprehending Deserters, that this Power must Necessarily be in the 
Congress, and that they certainly had Power to authorise any persons in 
the states to put them in Execution. That the Power of taking up 
deserters was in every soldier and officers of the army, and that the Con- 
gress might make any Justice of Peace in any state such an Officer and 
thereby give him that Pow-er, and if by making him an Officer they could 
give him that Power, they surely could without, that the officers and 
soldiers of the army were certainly not subject to the Laws of the states. 
That this was no more than what was every day done in appointing 
commissari [es] to purchase provisions and other things under the resolves 
of Congress. That the Congress had always directed their resolves to 
be put in Execution by Committess of Inspection and it was never denied 
that they had Power 

The Delegate of North Carolina answered that he admitted Continental 
objects were subjects of Continental Councils but denied that the pro- 
visions made by Continental Councils were to be enforced by Continental 
authority. That it would be giving Congress a Power to prostrate all 
the Laws and Constitutions of the states because they might create a 
Power within each that must act entirely Independant of them, and might 
act directly contrary to them that they might by virtue of this Power 
render Ineffectual all the Bariers Provided in the states for the Security 
of the Rights of the Citizens for if they gave a Power to act coercively 
it must be against the subject of some State, and the subject of every state 
was entitled to the Protection of that particular state, and subject to the 
Law^s of that alone, because to them alone did he give his consent, that 
he hoped the Gentleman would not Insist on this Principle which in its 



February, 1777 277 

Nature was so very Extensive and alarming. That the states alone had 
Power to act coercively against their Citizens, and therefore were the only 
Power competent to carry into execution any Provisions whether Conti- 
nental or Municipal, that he was well satisfied no Power on Earth would 
ever obtain authority to act coercively against any of the Citizens of the 
state he represented except under their own Legislature; unless it was 
obtained by Violence, that His fellow Citizens were struggling against 
unlawful exertions of Power, and they would submit to them from no 
authority, that he admitted the army to be a proper object to be governed 
and directed by Continental Councils, and that it is proper the Congress 
should provide for punishing Desertion, and that Desertion was a very 
[great] evil, but that who is a Deserter or who is not is a Question that 
must be determined previous to any Punishment, and who ever can 
determin it has a Power over the Life and Liberty of the Citizens, for as 
much as any man may be accused of Desertion but every one accused may 
not be Guilty, that If the Congress has the Power to appoint any Person 
to decide this Question the Congress has Power unlimitted over the Lives 
and Liberties of all men in America and the Provisions so anxiously made 
by the respective States to Secure them, at once Vanish before this Tre- 
mendous Authority, however proper it might be for Congress to punish 
Desertion it was Necessary for the states to prevent arbitrary and unjust 
punishments and Imprisonments of their Citizens, and unless some mode 
were provided for trying the above Question every man was liable to be 
imprisoned at the Discretion of Officers and servants of the Congress 
no power could be competent to this but such as is created by the Legis- 
lature of each state, and if any Question releated [sic'] to the Internal 
Polity of a state it certainly was this which Involved all the Rights of 
the Citizen's personal Freedom He would not speak for other states, but 
for his own he would declare that the Constitution had anxiously provided 
that no man should be Imprisoned or in any Degree Injured in his Person 
or Property but under the authority of the Laws of the state that it was a 
fundamental Maxim well understoo[d] there that no Magisterial author- 
ity could be given, but by the Legislature, and none could be exercised 
beyond what was expressly laid down in the Laws. The Congress cer- 
tainly could not give a Power within any state to hear and Determin 
Offence or to sieze and Imprison the Persons of the Citizens, yet most 
assuredly the Power contended for was no less, unless every Deserter was 
branded in the Face so that it could be determined without [doubt] who 
was Deserter and who was not. he was sorry to hear the Gentleman say 
that the Officers and Soldiers of the Army were not subject to the Laws 
of the States, and hoped the Gentleman would retract it, for assuredly the 
army must always be in some State and might be in every State, and if 
they were not subject to the Laws of the respective States, it would 
follow that a powerful Body of men within any State might Violate with 
Impunity all the Rights of the Citizens and subject them to the worst of 
Oppressions, that being contrary to all the purposes for which men enter 
into Society, the admission of it must dissolve all Society and Government,

and being peculiarly detested by the Americans who were struggling at 
the risque of Life and property against Oppression, it never could take 
place among them, until they lost all Common Sense, and all Love of 
Freedom That tiie Power of taking up deserters if it was in every officer 
and soldier it did not follow that every officer and soldier might call whom 
he pleased a deserter, and Imprison and punish him as such, that there 
must be a Power to determin whether deserter or not, and the Congress 
could give no such Power without giving authority to some Individuals 
within the states to exercise Magisterial Discretion and subject the citizens 
to that discretion, he could not conceive a state Independant if any 
Power could do this except their Internal Legislature who had their 
authority for that purpose from the People, he would declare firmly it 
could not be done in North Carolina by any other, if their Bill of Rights 
and Constitution were of any Effect, and not meer Waste paper, for 
they, provided that no free man within the state should be in any way or 
Degree restrained of his Liberty or damaged in his Property except under 
the Laws of the state to which h[is] consent must be given, because every 
freeman had a Voice [in the] Legislature. That in North Carolina no 
Military Officer could act in any civil department whatever, and he 
believed they could not in any state where Government was Established, 
yet if it were otherwise his civil authority must be derived from the state 
and not the Congress, and the rules and Limits whereby it was to be 
exercised must be expressly laid down by the state and could not be altered 
or extended by the Congress unless they had a Power over the Internal 
Laws of the states which Power never would be given, and no one pre- 
tended to. That the Difference was manifest between giving Commis- 
sions to purchase within the states, and giving Magisterial authority that 
one was only empowering some Individuals to exchange money for com- 
modities in fair contract which each party must previously agree to. here 
was not the shadow of restraint but was founded on the most liberal Idea 
of Consent, no Contract being valid unless all the Transactions are bona 
fide consented to by all the contractors, and it was every day done by 
Individuals of the states the most remote, and unconnected with each 
other that the other was enabling Individuals to hear and determin 
accusations against other Individuals, to pass Judgement, and to subject 
them to punishment, which surely was the highest act of Dominion, and 
could be Justified only by the Laws of the state which had the consent 
and authority of the People (here he Illustr[at]ed by quoting the case of 
the Negro Somerset).* That it was true the Congress directed their 
resolves to the Committees of Inspection to be put in Execution, but surely 
it must be remembered that the Congress recommended to the states to 
appoint such for that purpose, and the states did appoint them accordingly, 
their authority was certainly derived from that appointment, and not from 
the Congress, in North Carolina the matter was beyond dispute for the

resolves which constituted Committees expressly empowered them to 
execute the resolves of the Continental Congress. 

Mr. Wilson in reply admitted that he laid down the Principle too 
largely, and that when he said the officers and soldiers were not subject 
to the Laws of the states he meant only that in their Military duty they 
were subject only to the Congress he did not directly answer the argu- 
ment from North Carolina but argued ah inconveniente that the Power 
was Necessary he said if the states alone were competent to this Power 
it would follow that no deserter could be punished or apprehended but in 
the state where he inlisted, and consequently by keeping out of that state 
he was sure of Impunity â€” that this was in Effect declaring that desertion 
could not be punished and consequently that the army might be imme- 
diately disbanded, that he did not contend for giving the Power to 
Justices of the Peace etc. as such, but as Individuals proper to execute the 
resolution he moved to amend by taking out the words suspected of 
being, which would leave it deserters which he hoped would remove all 
objections. 

Mr. R. H : Lee from Virginia said it was a Misfortune to be too learned, 
that he could see no more in it, than he saw every day in the Newspapers 
which was advertising and offering a Reward for Deserters, and this 
was certainly exercising no Magisterial Power. 

Mr. J. Adams from Massachusetts confessed the matter passed him 
without his attention, that he was inclined to think from what passed 
that the articles of War must be enacted into Laws in the several states, 
and he believed the officers thought so or they would proceed with greater 
Vigor. 

The Delegate from North Carolina rejoined to all these. â€” to Mr 
Wilson. That Necessity was never to be admitted as an argument for 
assuming a Dangerous and improper Pow[er] tho it might be admitted 
as an Excuse for some particular unlawful exercise of authority, and then 
the Necessity must appear striking and Inevitable, to the Power which 
Judges an[d] Excuses the act. that otherwise the Plea of Necessity 
woul[d] subvert all restraints laid on persons entrusted with p[ower 
and?] authority, and always had been used by T[yra]nts for [that] pur- 
pose. Instance ship money, dispensations, and the presen[t] oppressive 
Proceedings of Britain, but even that Plea had no foundation here, the 
states were competent to enact Laws for the apprehending deserters, and 
there surely was no reason to doubt but that they would on a recom- 
mend [ation] for that purpose, that the Inconvenience the Gentleman 
mentioned was Imaginary. It will not follow that desertion could not be 
prevented or punished altho it should be admitted that the states alone 
were competent to give the Power of arresting suspected persons, and 
trying the Question deserter or not, nor could it be concluded from this 
that deserters could be apprehended nowhere but in the states where they 
enlisted. That desertion was a Crime and like all other Crimes to be 
punished whereever it should be committed, and by the Power who had 
competent Jurisdiction, that the Crime once committed the offender 
23 



2S0 Continental Congress 

might be apprehciuled in any state and removed to tlic Jurisdictifin vvlio 
had power to puiiisli. but every In(Hvidu[al] who might be ai)prehended 
had a right to call for the Iiiterposi[ti]on of the state where he was appre- 
hended to Enquire whether he was a person liable to suspicion, and 
whether the restraint of his Liberty was lawful or not. but the Power to 
Interpose in this manner could only be derived from the Internal Legisla- 
ture so [ ?] the Power to arrest must be derived from the same source, 
or it would follow that the citizens of each state might be restrained of 
their Liberty by an authority not derived from themselves which could 
not subsist witli freedom and Independance. tis plain from these con- 
siderations that desertion was no more secure of Impunity, than Murder, 
for in both the offender must be assisted by Virtue of an authority derived 
from the state where found, and each must be tried by the competent 
Jurisdiction and punished according to the Laws of the Community 
against which he offended. The amendment would [not] rem[ove the 
ojbjection because whether the word suspected was in or not [the 
objecjtions must remain the same, no one could be more than suspect [ed 
befjore conviction, and the Question of Guilt or Innocence must be 
[determined] some where previous to punishment 

The Distinction between Magistrates as Magistrates, and as persons 
proper to execute resolves was incomprehensible, if any thing render 
them more proper than freeholders it was what distinguished them from 
Freeholders which certainly was being Magistrates, and what but their 
authority as Magistrates rendered them fitter for Executing the resolve? 
twas surely their Power that was considered as rendering them more fit, 
and whence could they derive their Power but from their Quality as 
Magistrates? in fact it Avas an attempt to convey authority from the 
Congress to the Magistrates of the states, which would Involve the Per- 
sonal right of every citizen and which could be derived from no Power 
but the People of the respective states. 

To Mr Lee The Difference is certainly very perceptable between offer- 
ing a reward to any Individual who shall apprehend Deserters and subject 
them to the proper tribunals for deciding concerning Guilt or Innocence 
(for the advertisements could have no other Effect) and Impowering 
persons in the States to decide this Question, and to Imprison and remove 
out of the state in consequence of such decision, the One was no more 
than Inviting people to run the hazard of an action for being mistaken, 
and to be delligent in looking out for deserters by hopes of the reward, 
but the other was giving Power to Exercise discrition in deciding Guilt 
or Innocence, and consequently of freedom and Imprisonment, and Event- 
ually Life and Death, that in the latter case no remedy could be had for 
the Injury, if the Congress could give the Power because the Magistrate 
must decide Judicially, and must be subject to no punishment for being 
^listaken, because every Judge undertook to use his best endeavours to 
discover Truth, but did not promise to be Infallible, but the states would 
undoubtedly punish the IMagistrate, for acting without Jurisdiction, which 
would prove they did not admit the power of Congress

To Mr. Adams. The Congress was Impowered by the several states to 
levy an Army, and to conduct the War, and the Government of the army 
v^^as Incident to that Power the army could not be governed without rules 
and such rules were the articles of War, which the Congress undoubtedly 
had a right to make, and every soldier was particularly] bound to submit 
to them, because he consents to be governed by them, and tried and pun- 
ished by them not by representation merely but by actual person â€” consent, 
for they are read to him at the time of Inlistm[ent.] But the Power of 
Congress could not extend to subject any other but such as enlisted and 
personally consented to the articles of War, and it was the Duty of the 
states to Interpose whenever the Question arose whether soldier or not, 
because otherwise their citizens might be subjected to Martial Law against 
their Consent, and when ever any soldier apprehended the courts martial 
exceeded their Jurisdiction he had a right to bring the matter before the 
civil Tribunal of the State where he was, because other wise the Military 
might become absolute and Independant of the civil authority. 

During this Debate Mr. Wilson Instanced a case where the Congress 
had committed a man by their own authority, and no objection made. 

The Delegate from N. C : declared he was sorry to hear it, but would 
excuse it because he would suppose some special circumstances of Neces- 
sity, he declared had he been present it should not have passed without 
Opposition, and he hoped it never would be repeated for since no Power 
could call the Congress to account, if they could Imprison, they might do 
the greatest wrong without any remedy, and the Liberty of America 
would be at the mercy of a Majority in Congress which mig[ht] not 
Exceed five members, because nine states make a Congress, and there are 
more than five represented by a single member.

Feby 26th. The Question came on again relative to Interest on Loan 
certificates and it was determined to give the six per cent, Connecticut 
assenting and giving a Majority, because it drew Georgia with it.^ 

There was an attempt to extend the Interest to the certificates which 
should be given in payment of Lottery prizes, but it was rejected, the 
debates were long and troublesome, but unimportant. North Carolina 
was always against the Increase of Interest because the delegate con- 
sidered it a resolution to carry on the War at 6 per cent Interest rather 
than four, and that any sum of money which might be accumulated in the 
great cities even if they could be borrowed at six per cent yet the advantage 
arising from that acquisi [ti]on by no means compensated for the increased 
interest at which the War must be carried on.' 

The Question was put in the morning for an adjournment to Philadelphia* 
all the southern Delegates were against it except Georgia who always 
votes with Connecticut.^ the reasons were given that so much business 
of Consequence was before the Congress it was improper to suspend that 
Business by an adjournment at so busy a season that the weather w^as so 
bad. and several states so circumstanced there was very little probability 
of the Congress meeting at Philadelphia in several Weeks, that the 
General was of Opinion that the Enemy Intended an attack on Philadel- 
phia and if they attempted it he had no force to stop them, in fine that it 
w'ould be foregoing a certainty of doing Business for a very great uncer- 
taint}'. for it.^ the only reason of any weight came from the Board of War 
which was that for want of ]Mechanics, and Waggons the Business of 
their department went on verj' heavily at Baltimore, this was answered 
by observing that an adjournment would cause an entire suspension of 
that and all business, and there was no probability of an early meeting at 
Philadelphia, there was a peevish altercation on the ]\Iatter, and the 
delegate from North Carolina moved to put off the Question on behalf

of the Colony, a Fierce debate ensued J : Adams, Doctr Weatherspoon 
Mr Wilson, Mr Sherman and some others alledged that it must be refered 
to a Majority whether the rule could apply to this case, and in short 
whether the Colony should be permitted to exercise the right of post- 
poning the Question. R : H : Lee with great pirspicuity and force of 
argument urged the violent Impropriety of putting such a Question at a 
time when a state attempted to avail itself of a Privilege reserved to each 
by the original Rules of the Congress which certainly formed ^ its Con- 
stitution, and that if the rule was thought inconvenient the proper way 
would be to let the stat[e] first av[a]il itself thereof and afterwards con- 
sider the rule and alter and amend it if thought Necessary. F. L: Lee 
observed that the rule was originally intended to prevent a Majority from 
deciding on any matter with too much precipitation and if it was to be 
submitted to a Majority when it was proper to apply the rule, or when a 
state might avail itself of it, the Majority would always determin against 
applying it at all. Mr Haywood from S. Carolina urged that he thought 
it a very extraordinary kind of proposition to submit to a Majority 
whether that Majority should be checked by a Power apsolutely reserved 
for that purpose in the Constitution of the Congress. The Delegate from 
North Carolina declared that he would enter into no Debate on the subject 
whether he should avail himself of a right which was reserved to every 
state in the Original Constitution of the Congress, that those rules must 
have been entered into by Common consent, and nothing but common 
consent could dispense with them that if a Majority of Congress could 
vote away the rules of the Congress which common consent had Estab-

arbitrary discretion, that if this was the Case no state was secure, a 
Majority might vote that two three four or five states should form a 
Congress, altho the present rule required nine, that the votes should not 
be by states but by voice Individually, in short any the smalest Number 
of the Delegates might take upon them the whole authority of the Con-

to exercise an arbitrary tyrannical discrition and if it was done he should 
consider it as a most violent Invasion of the right of his state which he 
would endeavour to resent as became him. that [if] the Question was at 
all put he should be at no loss how to conduct himself, that he would 
always to the best of his Judgement make a prudent use of any privilege 
with which he was Invested, but he hoped he should always have firmness 
enough to maintain every the smallest Privilege of the state he represented, 
that gentlemen were exceedingly mistaken if they deemed him a Man who 
would tamely suffer any Invasion or encroachment on its Rights, that, 
if that Assembly proceeded to so arbitrary and Tyrannical an Exertion of 
Power he would consider it as no longer That which ought to be trusted 
with the Liberties of their Fellow Citizens, and he would shape his conduct 
accordingly.Â® The Delegates of New Hampshire Maryland, Virginia and

Sir 

VVe have this night rec'd from Congress the dispatches sent herewith, 
by these you will see the promotions that have taken place and that no 
deputation of Members of Congress are to meet Genl Lee, who I suppose 
will be much disapointed but surely he shou'd have pointed out more 
clearly the design of his request, as the consequences of complyance or 
even of the refusal may be important. It woud appear from what we 
have lately heard that Genl. Howe intends sending him to England which 
we shall be sorry for, as such a measure may possibly involve in its con- 
sequences more destruction than either side really wnsh for.^ We have 
recommended to Congress either to remain where they are, or if they do 
remove to let it be to Lancaster which we think wou'd be much more con- 
venient than Baltimore, the Public business meets great obstructions 
from their distance and the difficulties of getting dispatches backwards 
and forwards, they are exceedingly retarded by bad roads and the 
frequent stoppage at Susquehannah Ferry and in our oppinion when they 
did move they shou'd have gone to Lancaster, if they remove again 
before Genl. Howes designs are clearly evinced or frustrated, it shou'd be 
there. We Issued orders last Week to have all the Public Stores in readi- 
ness to remove from this place and are now urging to every department 
the propriety of carrying those orders into execution not only so far as 
relates to their being in readiness but as to the actual removing of them 

* There are only minor verbal or phrasal variations between this abstract of 
debate on the adjournment and that in A''. C. State Recs. To the latter is added the 
sentence: "The next day the adjournment was carried." Two typographical errors 
which affect the sense have been noted above.

[February'] zy. the Question for adjournment came on again and Vir- 
ginia South Carolina and Maryland strenuously opposed it as exceedingly 
impolitic and Improper, their arguments were very conclusive but 
entirely ineffectual. North Carolina only observed that he would give 
his dessent in such Terms as might make an Impression on the memory 
of the Gentlemen present that he would spare this could he enter it on the 
Journal but since he could not he must provide by this means for his 
Defence, in case he should be Impeached hereafter for any thing passing 
in Congress, he must expect to call on the Gentlemen as Witnesses how he 
v^oted, since he could not produce the Testimony of the Journals â€” that he 
was sorry to perceive that a predetermined Majority was as much a ratio 
ultima in Congress as in the British Parliament â€” that he was no way 
anxious for the personal safety of Congress, he believed if they were all 
killed or Captivated public Business wou[ld] suffer no other Injury except 
the delay until other members could be chozen, that he knew his country 
had much better men than himself, and he believed every state has as good 
as any in Congress, but he would give his Negative for the plain reason 
that it was very Imprudent to put a certain stop to Important Business, 
and run a very precarious hazard of resuming it agai[n] even after an 
Interval of some Weeks which would be an Inevitable delay, the adjourn- 
ment was carried, for it M : B : R : I : Connecticut N : J : Pennsylvania, 
Georgia again [st] it New Hampshire Maryland Virginia, N: Carolina, 
S : Carol [ina]^ The same day Mr Chase from Maryland offered a resolu- 
tion for entering all the Proceedings whether passing in the negative or 
affirmative on the Journals, and the yeas and no's if any state required it, 
also that the Congress doors should be opened, except on particular Occa- 
sions â€” and all Debates held in public â€” he was seconded by North Carolina 
who observed it was very proper the Congress should have the public 
check on them, and that as every member was liab[le] to be impeached 
by the state he represented, it was a Justice to him and to the state that 
his votes should be entered on the Journals, that the state might be furn- 
ished with Testimony to prosecute, and the Delegate with Testimony to 
defend himself â€” postponed.'

Sir: 

The bearer has permission to go to your State to solicit the discharge 
of the prisoners taken after the defeat at Moores' Creek. He being a 
simple unobnoxious creature, I consented to his going, at their request, 
tho' their endeavour was to get some more knowing one. I believe his 
embassy will not be very successful ; for I told them they must not expect 
ever to live in North Carolina on any other terms than swearing allegiance 
to the State and giving security for their good behavior : but this they do 
not relish. They are desirous of knowing whether their families and 
property will be reserved for them, if they are exchanged. Farquhard 
Campbell speaks with much resentment and hautiness; he seems to think 
the State ought to court him to become her subject. I found they were not 
at all secure in close confinement, and the guarding them was exceedingly 
expensive. I therefore consented to their being on parole in Frederick 
Town in this State. They are incessant importimers, and I believe every 
Delegate is glad they are removed from the residence of Congress. Angus 
McDonald, the bearer, is to return to them if you think proper.^

distance from the seat of war, especially at a time when a new army is 
forming.* .... Congress never gave any orders at any time not to risque 
a general battel, as was reported last fall, but always left that matter to 

the discretion of the commanding officers It seems to be the 

present opinion of the Congress that there be no further emission of bills 
than what is already ordered, if it can possibly be avoided, and tiiat the 
most effectual measures be taken to support the credit of those already 
emited. Accordingly a tax is recommended to the several States, and as 
the rule to determine the quotas is not yet established by the legislatures 
of the several States (which is to be done by the Confederation) each 
State is called upon to raise as large a sum as circumstances will admit, 
with an engagement to allow interest at 6 per cent for what any State may 
raise more than its just quota of the whole sum tliat shall be raised.' .... 
Your Honr has doubtless been informed of the promotions lately made 
of general officers in the army; previous to the choice the Congress 
resolved, " That in the appointment of general officers due regard shall be 
had to the line of succession, personal merit, and the number of troops 
raised or to be raised by the several States." We mentioned Brigadiers 
Wooster and Arnold as candidates for Major Generals on the two first 
principles, and Brigadier Wadsworth and Colo Huntington, who were 
both recommended by General Washington, as fit persons for Brigadiers; 
but the last principle prevailed to pass them all by â€” viz, That Connecticut 
had more general officers than in proportion to the number of troops 
furnished by that State.* ....

3 In the Mass. Hist. Soc. (C 81 A 4) is a draft of this letter which varies greatly 
from the letter printed in the Mass. Hist. Soc, Collections, which was the letter sent. 
In this draft is the following paragraph : " Congress has increased the interest of money 
borrowed and to be borrowed in the loan offices to 6 pr cent, having Information from 
Boston and Philadelphia that money could not be procured at a lower interest. Men who 
live on the interest of their money are unwilling to lessen their income when their 
expenses are increasing by the rise of every necessary. Congress has recommended to 
the Legislatures of the States to raise as large a Sum by a Tax the current year as their 
circumstances will admit. It is hoped that each State will raise its Quota of 3 million 
Dollars at least, [if] they be allowed six per cent pr. annum for what any of them raise 
more than their Quota." See the resolves relative to the proceedings of the New England 
committee, Feb. 15; also Burke's abstract, Feb. 26 (no. 384, ante). Cf. the Journals,

(Nicholas Cooke). ^ 

Philadelphia, March 6th, 1777. 

Sir: â€” 

.... As a State Lottery is one of the Measures that Congress hath 
taken to put a Stop to the Torrent of Depreciation, I hope it will be 
countenanced and encouraged by the State of Rhode Island and that the 
Loan-Office too will be patronised and promoted.^ The Interest on the 
Loan-Office-Certificates was lately raised to Six per Centum, which I 
should think would be a sufficient Inducement to Money Lenders to lend 
their Money ; especially when it is considered that if large Sums of 
Money can be borrowed it will tend greatly to check the sinking Credit of 
Continental Money, and thereby benefit them as well as others.' Congress 
have Resolved that the Paper Bills issued by the States might be received 
at the Loan-Office and exchanged for Certificates ; and that the Bills so 
received should remain there, and go as far as they might toward the 
Payment of the continental Debt due to the respective States ; * and 
accordingly Letters to this purpose have been transmitted to the Keepers 
of the Loan-Offices in the Several States. I mention this the more particu- 
larly ; because it will probably prevent Congress from ordering the Com- 
mi* of the Loan Office in our State to issue Notes for the Payment of the 
Debt due to it ; which is a Mode pointed out by you in Case it should be 
impracticable to supply Messrs. Greene and Howell with the Money asked 
for. I returned here the Day before Yesterday. The Weather hath been 
so bad as to prevent Members enough from coming up to make a Congress. 
As soon as they meet I shall use my Influence to procure an Order on the 
Treasury for the Money ; Â® but not with any Hopes of Success at present ; 
for there is not more than a Million Dollars in the Treasury, and that 
Sum is already mortgaged.^

until the five millions of dollars which are ordered to be struck should have been com- 
pleted. However, I will do all I can in this, as well as every matter directed by the State 
of Rhode Island, etc., and hope I shall be able to get some money, although I utterly 
despair of obtaining a quarter part of what is now due. The President will, I presume, 
transmit to you the resolves recommending it to the States not to emit more money ; nor 
borrow at a higher rate of interest than six per cent., etc.''

PiiiLADA. March 6th. 1777 
Dear Sir 

.... It is truly lamentable that we have never been able to this day to 
Conquer that h""un(laniental error made in the outset, by short enlistments, 
it was not untill Conviction of the absolute necessity of it stared every 
man in tiie Face that the wholesome measure of enlisting for three years 
or during the War, could be carried in Congress and since it was carried 
there, it meets with insuperable obstacles raised by the former practice, 
for the Bounties, high wages and short Service has vitiated the Minds of 
all that Class of people and they are grown the most mercenary beings 
that exist.' .... 

In the mean time the public Stores are removing, and Congress have 
adjourned back to this place many of the Members are come up and the 
rest on the road. I dont expect they will make a House sooner than 
Monday, but your late dispatches shall be delivered to the President soon 
as he arrives. I wish with you Sir that they had complyed w'ith General 
Lee's request, and when I sent forward those dispatches to Baltimore I 
wrote my sentiments to some of the Members and altho it woud have 
been inconvenient for me and I urged not to be appointed on that errand 
yet I would have gone rather than he shoud have been disapointed. 
Whether they will take up the matter again or not I don't know, but I 
much doubt it as from the little conversation I have had with some of the 
Members now here they seem very averse to it. however I expect this 
matter as well as the confinement of the Hessian Field officers will at 
least be referred to the Consideration of a Committee in consequence of 
your letters on the Subject and if I can influence a Complyance with your 
wishes it will give me pleasure for my own Sentiments coincide with yours 
exactly in these two points at the same time I must hint to you what I take 
to be one of the most forcible arguments that probably has been used in 
Congress against this Measure. I have not heard that it was used, but as 
it occurred to myself on reading Genl Lee's letters I mean the effect it may 
have at the Court of France shou'd they hear as they undoubtedly woud 
that Members of Congress visited Genl Lee by permission of the British 
Commissioners. The meeting with Ld. Howe at Staten Island last Sum- 
mer injured Air Deane's negotiations much and retarded supply's intended 
for us.^ I am now at the 15th of March and must appologize to you Sir 
for not answering fully your letter and for not having sent this away long 
since; but I have been attacked by a weakness in my Eyes, and writing is 
the most dangerous thing I can do whilst it continues. On this account I

Congress have once more Ventured to this Town, where I shall be glad 
to hear from you when Opportunity Presents. I have Nothing interesting 
either to the Public or your self to Communicate. I was in hopes before 
this to have been able to inform you Congress had to some purpose con- 
sidered your extraordinary Services. The com^ apptd. for that purpose 
reported a reward for you, not great, but such as would have been useful 
to you at this Time, Congress allowed your Merrit and desert but seemed 
loath to make a pecuniary reward, and recommitted the report, desiring 
the Com^ to keep it for the Present to see if something worthy for them 
to give and you to receive would not fall in the way. Some began to think 
it right to Suffer you to hold the Office of Paymaster to that of Chaplain 
and they Agreed to raise the Chaplains pay to 40 dollars â€” but nothing 
is yet determined. I can assure you of nothing but that you have some 
hearty friends in Congress, and would have more were you not a Presbyt" 
Clergyman. If any thing arises I hope it will be Acceptable, but till it 
does come don't Appropriate it, nothing is more uncertain than a depen- 
dance upon public bodies, they are moved like the wind, but rather more 
uncertain. I shall watch for a favourable gale.^ ....

(Richard Caswell).* 

Philadelphia March nth 1777. 
Sir 

Our adjournment from Baltimore has put all our Proceedings to a 
stand and our unsettled Situation has prevented my writing to you as 
often as I at first Intended. I believe you have no cause to regret it, for 
I had nothing to communicate worth your attention. 

The more experience I acquire, the stronger is my Conviction, that 
unlimited Pozver can not be safely Trusted to any man or set of men on 
Earth. No men have undertaken to exercise authority with Intentions 
more generous and disinterested than the Congress and none seem to 
have fewer or more feeble motives for increasing the Power of their 
body Politic. What could Induce Individuals blest with peaceable domes- 
tic affluence to forego all the enjoyment of a pleasing home, to neglect 
their private affairs, and at the expence of all their time and some part of 
their private fortunes, to attend public Business under many Insurmount- 
able Difficulties and Inconveniences? What but a generous Zeal for the 
public ? And what can Induce such men to Endeavour at increasing the 
Power with wdiich they are Invested, when their Tenure of it must be 
exceedingly Dangerous and precarious and can bring them Individually 
neither pleasure or profit? this is a Question I believe cannot be answered 
but by a plain declaration that Power of all kinds has an Irresistible pro- 
pensity to increase a desire for itself, it gives the Passion of ambition a 
Velocity which Increases in its progress, and this is a passion which grows 
in proportion as it is gratified. I hope sir you will pardon me these Reflec- 
tions. I know they have not escaped you. but I find my attendance in 
Congress, short as it has been, obtrudes them on me every day. great 
part of our time is consumed in debates, whose object on one side is to 
increase the Power of Congress, and on the other to restrain it. The 
advocates do not always keep the same side of the Contest, the same 
persons who on one day endeavour to carry through some Resolutions, 
whose Tendency is to increase the Power of Congress, are often on an 
other day very strenuous advocates to restrain it. from this I infer that 
no one has entertained a concerted design to increase the Power; and 
the attempts to do it proceed from Ignorance of what such a Being ought 
to be. and from the Delusive Intoxication which Power Naturally imposes 
on the human Mind.^. . . . 

These and many other considerations make me earnestly wish that the 
Power of Congress was accurately defined and that there were adequate 
Check provided to prevent any Excess. I am also exceedingly desirous

to have particular Instructions relative to some Heads which I shall 
Inclose to you to be laid before the assembly. One thing now embarasses 
me very much, it is this. Whenever any Matter wherein the Jurisdiction 
or authority of Congress is contested is debated, it is usual to lay it over 
undetermined, by the rule of secrecy you know, Sir, I am not at liberty 
to communicate anything before it is determined and therefore cannot 
Consult the State upon it. in these cases all our time is lost, for nothing 
is entered on the Journals, and nothing therefore can give Testimony 
hereafter that such points were contested, and even reject [ed] by a 
majority as is indeed the usual case.^ Relative to the measures Intended 
to be pursued by Congress I have nothing new to add. they are Endeav- 
ouring at a foreign alliance, and have some hopes of success, they will 
Increase as much as possible their Naval Force, and are using every 
Endeavour to recruit a strong army to take the Field early in the Spring, 
their Endeavours in this respect will be ineffectual if not earnestly 
seconded by the States. I have no doubt Sir of your most particular 
attention to this Important object. I am often suggesting to Congress 
that the Civil Power of the States is the best Instrument for calling forth 
their Proportion of Exertions in this or any Cause, but they hear with 
reluctance any thing that looks like the Interposition of such a Power in 
Military affairs, tho' no one will venture directly to oppose or reject it. 
I need not repeat to you my own Thoughts on this subject, you have 
often heard me deliver them. I have not yet altered my Opinion. With 
respect to Intelligence I will enclose you the papers and anything not 
contained in them I will subjoin. 

I enclose you an abstract of the Debates in Congress on every Question 
of any Consequence that has been determined in Congress since my last. 
By these you will see what has been decided, and why. You will from 
them also better Judge of the various Opinions, or rather the fluctuations 
of Opinion in Congress, this is an Evil from which nothing but experi- 
ence, and a better Constitution of Congress can deliver us. my own 
Opinions, being those in which my Country is particularly Interested. I 
wish her to be fully informed of. I shall submit them to you Sir as her 
principal Guardian, with all the simplicity of unadorned Truth, and when 
they are reprehensible I wish them to be reproved, that the public servants 
in this Department may better learn their Duty, and that I in particular 
may be Instructed not to give the sense of the State in a Manner which she 
may not approve. The last Matter in the abstract will shew you that even 
thus early, men so eminent as members of Congress, are willing to explain 
away any Power that stands in the way of their particular purposes.* 
what may we not expect some time hence, when the Seat of Power shall 
become firm by Habit, and men will be accustomed to Obedience, and 
perhaps forgetful of the Original principles w'hich gave rise thereto. I 
believe Sir the Root of the Evil is deep in human Nature, its growth

may be kept clown but it cannot be entirely extirpated. Power will some- 
time or other be abused unless men are well watched, and checked by some- 
thinqf which they cannot remove when they please 

Our expenses here Sir are incredible, every Horse is ten Shillings a 
Day, and every thing else is in proportion. It is now the 19th of March 
and since our arrival in this City we have done nothing, we had barely 
a Congress for a few days last week, but none this week yet." the few 
members in Town are closely engaged in Committees, and what I write 
is done in the time when other People are asleep. You will therefore not 
wonder, should you find it very Incorrect. 

There are letters from Doctr. Franklin in France of the loth of decem- 
ber. they represent a War in Europe as certainly iminent and we have 
received very particular marks of the Favor of the French Court, which 
I am not at liberty to disclose." 

You will See a Resolution in the Papers recommending to the States 
to assess Blankets for the soldiery.^ This is absolutely Necessary, because 
such things can not otherwise be had in our State 

Tis probable. Sir, the Assembly may make choice of some more able 
men to serve in this Department. I should be very far from deeming it 
an Injury to me, and I am certain it could be none to the State. I have 
resolved very early in this Dispute to decline no service that my country 
require me to perform altho almost all offices are equally out of my way, 
and none are desirable to me. But if the Assembly shall think proper to 
direct me to continue in this Department, I hope I may be allowed to 
return to my private affairs for a few weeks in the Summer, if I have 
this permission I promise Sir that I will not avail myself of it to the delay 
or prejudice of public Business.^ . . . â€¢

directing several articles to be purchased out of the Montgomery's Prizes 
for the use of the State, which, it was not in my power to execute for the 
following reasons vizt. upon an application of Congress setting forth, 
that as several hundred Recruits for the new Battalions were daily com- 
ming into this town from the States of Virginia, and Maryland in order 
to reinforce Genl. Washingtons Army, and these being destitute of proper 
Cloathing etc. it would be absolutely necessary that the several articles 
captured by the Montgomery and suitable for the Soldiery should be 
applyed here, and requested my assent, which I perremptory refused. 
The next day it was moved in Congress that an order should Issue 
appointing four persons to appraise all the Woolen and linnens etc. suit- 
able for the Soldiery captured by the Montgomery armed Vessell. upon 
the motions being read I objected to the proceeding as partial, and gave 
the following reasons, that as the property was on condemnation vested 
in the State of New York, together with the Captain and Crew, of the 
Montgomery, and that the latter insisted upon having their property 
dissposed off in the customary manner at public Vendue, and urged the 
evil that might attend such a precedent, especially as I had directions from 
your Convention to purchase those Articles and forward them to you for 
the Cloathing your Troops, who they (the Congress) well knew that the 
State of N'' York in its present circumstance had no port open through 
which they could introduce any supplys ; but maugre all my objections the 
Question was put, and carried nemine Con. for the motion, and four

the appraizers when met, declared themselves inadequate to the appoint- 
ment, being totally unacquainted with the value of those goods, which 
together with the Capt. and Crew's opposition to that mode, produced an 
agreement between the Parties that all should be sold at Auction except 
the Woolens and course Linnens. which the Congress was to take at the 
Rates of a dollar Curr^ for what cost one shilling sterling, for the 
Woolens ; and 4/6 p yard for the course Linnens. the rest of the Cargo

his Command, he says " indeed I cannot blame them knowing their dis-

objections.* ....

403. Thomas Burke. Abstract of Debates.^ 

Philadelphia [March 14?] 1777 

There was a Debate on the subject of Retaliation soon after the arival 
of the Congress at Philadelphia, occasioned by a suggestion of General 
Washington that our circumstances made it impolitic to use such Lan- 
guage, the Enemy have a superiority over us in captive officers at least 

3 See the Journals, Feb. 25, 27. The Journals contain no record concerning this 
matter on Feb. 24, the day on which, according to Lewis, the application was made. Feb. 
27 Congress appointed three appraisers for the purpose. The resolution of Feb. 25 had 
authorized the board of war to appoint appraisers. See further, no. 441, note 2, post. 

* The letter of Washington here referred to is no doubt that of Jan. 26,

six to one, that there is still subsisting an agreement for exchange which 
the resolutions of Congress for retaliation might violate.^ 

Some extraordinary Opinions were thrown out by Mr, Loval and 
Doctor Weatherspoon, tending to the Doctrine that we were bound by 
no such agreements no longer than we found them convenient. Several 
Gentlemen denied this Doctrine, but maintained, that the Enemy's treat- 
ment of General Lee was an infringement on their part, and the agreement 
was therefore become void. North Carolina vehemently opposed the 
Doctrine alledging that it violated all public Faith, and was in a word 
declaring to mankind that we ought never to be trusted, that it was good 
policy even abstracted from all moral consideration, to keep inviolate the 
Faith of Nations, because on that alone was founded all compact between 
them, that to a young country the reputation of Fidelity was as Essential 
as that of Immaculate chastity to a young Beauty the smallest blot in 
either must sink the subject for ever in the Estimation of mankind, that if 
the Cartile (which he was not enformed of) was violated by the Resolu- 
tions of Congress, he was clearly of Opinion that they ought to be 
rescin[d]ed. the Debate now turned on the Question whether the Treat- 
ment of General Lee was an infringement, the Facts produced to prove 
it were the confinement of the General under Custody of the Provost at 
New York, and the Evasion of General How to the Question whether 
he should be considered as a prisoner of War or not North Carolina was 
of Opinion this did not amount to a Direct Breach, but that a Catigorical 
answer ought to be demanded and the Enemy informed that a refusal 
would be deemed a Breach, but that all farther proceeding was premature, 
the Congress were of a Different Opinion, and it appeared some days 
afterwards that General Washington thought of it in the same manner 
with the Congress.^

any injury arise ? Will it reflect any dishonor upon congress? I do not

It would take up too much time to recapitulate all the arguments which 
were used upon occasion of his letter. But congress was never more

unanimous than upon that question. Nobody, I believe, would have 
objected against a conference concerning- his private affairs or his par- 
ticular case. But it was inconceivable that a conference should be neces- 
sary upon such subjects. Any thing relative to these might have been 
conveyed by letter. But it appears to be an artful stratagem of the two 
grateful brothers to hold up to the public view the phantom of a negotia- 
tion, in order to give spirits and courage to the Tories, to distract and 
divide the Whigs at a critical moment, when the utmost exertions are 
necessary to draw together an army. They meant, further, to amuse 
opposition in England, and to amuse foreign nations by this manoeuvre, 
as well as the Whigs in America, and I confess it is not without indigna- 
tion that I see such a man as Lee suffer himself to be duped by their policy 
so far as to become the instrument of it, as Sullivan was upon a former 
occasion.'. . . . 



But further. We see what use government and the two houses make 
of the former conference with Lord Howe. What a storm in England 
they are endeavouring to raise against us from that circumstance. 

But another thing. We have undoubted intelligence from Europe that 
the ambassadors and other instruments of the British ministry at foreign 
courts made the worst use of the former conference. That conference 
did us a great and essential injury at the French court, you may depend 
upon it. Lord Howe knows it, and wishes to repeat it. 

Congress is under no concern about any use that the disaffected can 
make of this refusal. They would have made the worst use of a confer- 
ence. As to any terms of peace, look into the speech to both Houses, the 
answers of both Houses. Look into the proclamations. It is needless to 
enumerate particulars which prove that the Howes have no power but to 
murder or disgrace us. 

The retaliation that is to be practised on Lee's account, was determined 
on when I was absent, so that I can give no account of the reasons for that 
measure. Yet I have no doubt of the right; and as to the disagreeable 
consequences you mention, these, I hope and presume, will not take place. 
If they do, they will be wholly chargeable on the enemy. The end of 
retaliation is to prevent a repetition of the injury. A threat of retaliation 
is to prevent an injury, and it seldom fails of its design. In Lee's case, I 
am confident, it will secure him good treatment. If Lee's confinement is 
not strict, that of Campbell and the Hessians ought not to be. The inten- 
tion was that they should be treated exactly as Lee is. 

Our late promotions may possibly give disgust; but that cannot be 
avoided. This delicate point of honor, which is really one of the most 
putrid corruptions of absolute monarchy, I mean the honor of maintaining 
a rank superior to abler men, I mean the honor of preferring a single step 
of promotion to the service of the public, must be bridled. It is incom- 
patible with republican principles. I hope, for my own part, that congress 
will elect annually all the general officers. If, in consequence of this, some

great men should be obliged, at the year's end, to go home and serve their 
country in some other capacity, not less necessary, and better adapted to 
their genius, I do not think the public would be ruined. Perhaps it would 
be no harm. The ofificers of the army ought to consider that the rank, the 
dignity, and the rights of whole States are of more importance than this 
point of honor ; more, indeed, than the solid glory of any particular officer. 
The States insist, with great justice and sound policy, on having a share 
of the general officers in some proportion to the quotas of troops they are 
to raise. This principle has occasioned many of our late promotions, and 
it ought to satisfy gentlemen. But if it does not, they, as well as the 
public, must abide the consequences of their discontent. 

I shall at all times think myself happy to hear from you, my dear Sir, 
and to give the utmost attention to whatever you may suggest. I hope I

407. The President of Congress to George Washington/ 

Philadelphia March 17th. 1777. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to transmit to you sundry resolves of Congress of a 
very important Nature, to which I beg Leave to solicit your Attention.^ 

The Congress having had your Letters of the ist and 6th Inst, under 
Consideration, have come to the inclosed Resolve on the subject, by which 
you perceive they decline making any Alteration in the Resolve of the 
6th. January, and that it was not their Intention that Colo. Campbell 
should experience any other Hardship than such Confinement as is neces- 
sary to his Security for the end they had in View when they passed that 
Resolve. 

The obvious Distinction made by Genl. Howe in his Treatment of 
Genl. Lee who is notoriously committed to the Custody of the Provost 
and denied his parole, while our other Officers are admitted to it, w^as the 
ground on which Congress proceeded when they passed that Resolve, the 
Intention of which was to shew that in Proportion as Severities against 
him were increased the same Treatment should be exercised on six Field 
Officers 

The Principle of Retaliation was early adopted by the States of Amer- 
ica, and if adhered to, will be the most likely Way to prevent our Enemies 
from making Distinctions, which have no other Foundation but the Grati- 
fication of their Revenge, Genl. Lee having an undoubted Right to every 
Indulgence that our other Officers, Prisoners among them, may receive.^ 

I have wrote to the Governor and Council of Virginia, and likewise to 
Colo. Stephen on the Subject of the enclosed Resolves.*

The Congress have endeavoured to put a Stop to Foreigners coming over 
to America to enter the Service, not only by directing the Committee of 
Secret Correspondence to write to the Agents abroad to discourage them 
from such Views, but by declaring that they shall not be employed, unless 
they are well acquainted with our Language.'* 

Your several Favors of the 20th. 23d. and 28. Feby. and ist. and 6th.

Philadelphia 17th March 1777 
My Dear Sir, 

My last was the 22d Feby ^ since which I have not been favor'd with 
any of Yours. 

Congress adjourn'd the 28th and did not meet here till the nth inst ' 
and have now but a thin House, which makes the Business extreemly 
Laborious for those that attend, the whole time of the Members being 
taken up on Committees when the House is not setting. The expence of 
living here is beyond all Bounds, every thing has risen more than double 
since you left this, unless some effectual stop can be put to the sinking 
Curr^. I dont know what will be the Consequence, and how that is to be 
effected, I cannot devise, unless by taxation. ' why has not N. H. adoptd 
this measure? she is exceedingly fond of following the example of 
Massachusetts and Connecticut; in some things why not in this? which 
in my judgment is the wisest they ever set her. 

How goes on Your recruiting service? ....

little that I know of this matter; hut I am uiuler such injunctions and 
engagements, to communicate nothing relative to foreign affairs, that 1 
ought not to do it ; and, if I was at liberty, such is the risk of letters by

Deane; both agree that every thing is as they could wish; .... Thus

410. The President of Congress (John Hancock) to 

Philip Schuyler.^ 

Philadelphia March i8th. 1777. 
Sir, 

I have the Honour to transmit you sundry Resolves of Congress in 
Obedience to their Commands. 

The Number of Foreigners already employed in the Army of these 
States, is a prodigious Weight upon the Service; and the Evil is likely 
to encrease unless a speedy Stop can be put to it. For this Purpose, the 
Congress have not only determined that no Commissions should be 
granted to any foreign Officers who are ignorant of the English Language 
but have directed the Committee of Secret Correspondence to write to 
their Agents abroad to discourage Gentlemen from Coming to America, 
with expectation of being taken into the Service, unless they are acquainted 
with our Language.^ 

The Sense of Congress relative to some Expressions in your Letter of 
the [4 February] is so clearly conveyed in the enclosed Resolves, that I 
shall only add, it is their Expectation you will be more guarded for the 
future; and that you write in a stile better adapted to their rank and 
Dignity, as well as your own Character.^

Philadelphia March 18, 1777 
My dear Miss Scollay 

.... While I was in Baltimore, an opportunity presented of making 
a proposal which, if agreed to, would be honorary to my Friend and 
beneficial to his son. General Mercer having been slain in battle, or rather 
barbarously murdered,^ a motion was made in Congress for a monument 
to be erected to his memory, and that his youngest son should be educated 
at the expense of the continent. I did not think myself partial in judging 
that the services and merit of General Warren considered as a patriot or 
a soldier were not inferior to those of General Mercer, and therefore added 
to the motion that the same honor should be paid to his memory and that 
one of his sons should be educated. I proposed the eldest. It was agreed 
that my motion should be first entered on the journal, and a committee 
was appointed to consider of both. Congress soon after adjourned to this 
place. The Gentlemen of the Committee are not all of them arrived. I 
am persuaded it will be agreed to in the Committee, but as the determina- 
tion in the house may be uncertain, I think it best that it should not be 
made known abroad till we see the Events.' . . . . '

Philadelphia March 20th 1777 
Sir 

I received your favour of the loth Instant, by Mr Brown with a Copy 
of your account as settled by the Commissioners. 

After I saw you at Kingsbridge I returned to Congress but tarried there 
but a few days, the day before I went home Congress agreed to augment 
the Pay of the Regimental Officers.^ I supposed they would consider the 
Pay of the Stafl before they dismissed the subject but it seems they did 
not. their principal object at that time was to establish a new Army. 
When I left Congress there was as full a representation of the State of 
Connecticut as the Assembly allowed to attend at one time. I was detained 
at home by sickness some considerable time, while at home I received 
your letter of the 22d of October but could not give you a satisfactory 
answer till I returned to Congress. 

I arrived at Baltimore the 2d of January when General Wolcott shewed 
me your Letter to the Delegates, dated the i6th of Novr. with the repre-

sentation you had made to the Commissioners of Congress in the Northern 
department. 1 took the earhcst opportunity to move Congress on the 
Subject, upon which the Pay of the Staff officers was referred to the Board 
of War. On the 27th of January the Board reported as their opinion that 
your Pay ought to be augmented to 75 Dolhirs per month which was 
agreed to by Congress.^ Upon which I immediately wrote to you enclos- 
ing a Copy of the resolution,* but I suppose you were absent when the 
Letter arrived at Albany, as I understand by Mr Brown you have been 
at Lebanon about two months. There was also about the same time a sum 
of money, I think 500,000 Dollars, sent to the military Chest in your 
department. The Board of war reported in favour of augmenting the 
Pay of your Assistants and some other staff officers which lies before 
Congress not acted upon. I will move Congress to consider it.^ the Pay 
of your Assistants I am sensible is too low for the present times. I have 
had the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with Mr Pierce. Â° I know him 
to be a Gentleman of Abilities and Merit, and strict Integrity, such 
persons I wish may always meet with proper encouragement from the 
public. A Deputy Paymaster General is allowed 6 rations and a Regi- 
mental Paymaster 3, by a resolution of Congress of the loth of October 
last.'' 

As to what you mention of a neglect to give you information of the 
resolutions of Congress respecting the duties of your office, I am sure 
there has been no intention to treat you with Neglect, from any disesteem 
of your person or services, for I believe you have executed your Office to 
as good satisfaction as any Officer in the public service.^ The resolutions 
of Congress should be published monthly at least, for the information of 
all concerned, but Congress has not yet been able to procure it to be done : ' 
I understand by the President that he transmits to General Schuyler what 
respects the Northern department, expecting that he would give the need- 
ful information to others. Perhaps General Schuyler did not know but 
that the resolutions which respect your office had been transmited to you 
from Congress, which I think would be the proper way. I have sent you 
copies of some resolutions in time past but know not whether they came 
to hand.

Philadelphia, March 21st, 1777. 
Sir, 

.... I forgot to mention in my last the affair of the cannon which 
Congress requested the loan of ; ^ some gentlemen seemed much surprized 
at the prices of 70 and 80 pounds per ton, as some had been purchased and 
more engaged here at Â£40 this currency per ton. I understand the Salis- 
bury cannon are not so heavy as these ; therefore the difference of price 
is not so great as was imagined. When it was proposed to borrow them, 
we represented that they were wanted for the defence of the State of Con- 
necticut, and if lent others must be immediately provided in their stead, 
therefore we conceived Congress would not think such a requisition 
reasonable, but lest giving so high a price should make a bad precedent 
and raise the price here, it was resolved to apply to borrow them. We 
gave as a reason why they could not be afforded cheaper, that the furnace 
was rebuilt and put in blast at a great expence for the purpose of casting 
some cannon for the use of that State, the scarcity of wood, the high price 
of coal and the distance it was carted, etc

expedition possible : so that they may either join our troops already in

J. 'I'ruiiibull Esqr; 

March 22(1 [1777.] 

Sir: 

I wrote you a few T.ines, by Mr Bates, in regard to yr. manner of 
returning- your Commission. I was not aware of some circumstances, 
attending your appointment, which have upon this occasion been can- 
vassed. I shall not accurately enter upon any discussion, of the propriety 
or Impropriety of your resignation ; I sliall only, as an affectionate friend, 
give you this early Intelligence of a number of facts, which will enable 
you to make a final Determination in this Matter. 

The Commissions of several Inclos'd in Letters of less apparent resent- 
ment than your's had been readily admitted for resignation, some very 
cutting resolutions had been made, on insolent passages of the late Letters 

of S r.^ especially on those parts which called for stigmas on you or 

your Brother. Immediately your Letter is open'd, and by your friends 
committed, instead of the resignation being instantly accepted; a favour- 
able report was made, but overuled by a motion to postpone the considera- 
tion. Upon this G G ^ sent in a recommendatory letter, 

explaining the circumstances of your appointment.* But this would not 
do; Congress are highly piqu'd at the style and manner of your demand, 
in a Case which will appear to you now, in the line of favour, and not of 

strict right. You are to know, that G G 's power was in 

Canada,^ so that your appointment before his entrance there, was not 
strictly proper. Whether your first Commission was dated after any 
formal Debate upon this point, I cannot say, but that, and the late one are 
of one Date, founded on your nomination in Congress,* I suppose. Every 
Member is entirely willing to accord you a Commission agreeable to the 
Date you expect ; but they are as determin'd on the other Hand, to lose, 
even your acknozuledg'd abilities^ if they do not receive a Different Request 
from what is now before them. 

You were certainly unacquainted with the Criticisms which may take 

place on G G s power of appointment out of Canada. You 

are also unacquainted with the provocations which have been given to 
Congress for attention to the Style of the Letters of their officers, prior 

to the Receipt of your's. Gen : G is attach'd to you, the Congress 

admit your Merit ; and, while they are dispos'd to give you a Rank which

To the Hon* J : H : Esqr etc.^ 

Sir: 

Since I address'd a Letter to yr: Honour from Providence, enclosing 
my Commission, I have been led to find I was mistaken in the Apprehen- 
sion that my Appointment to the office of De. A. Genl. â€” on the 28th of 
June, from which time I have acted, was so much in the usual manner, as 
to render my Commission bearing an after Date, a decisive Degradation, 
when compared with usual practice ; but, the same desire of serving my 
Country in the most effectual Manner, which had govern'd all my actions, 
in the course of my Adjutancy, since the day of my first Appointment, 
leads me to be anxious that I may not be under any appearances of Dis- 
grace, from any circumstance in my Commission as this would lessen the 
Efficacy of my most vigorous Exertions. Therefore I entreat your Honor 
would move the Honble Congress to favor me with a Commission con- 
sonant in Date to my Appointment from Genl. Gates ; assuring them of my 
Zeal for the Service of the United States, and of the greatest Respect for 
their Body. 

I am 

Hon* Sir, etc. 

I do not afifect to point out a verbal exact model for you. It is the tenor 
only. With something similar you may be assur'd of an instant comply- 
ance here; The Delay therefore depends on yourself. I hope you will 
make none *

Sir, 

We are commanded by Congress to transmit Copies of their Resolve 
of the 13 instant to all the Gentlemen abroad that hold correspondance 
with any of their Committees The Necessity of such a resolution and 
due attention to it, is fully evinced by the heavy expence america has been 
put to by many Gentlemen received into their Service, who have found it 
impossible to render themselves usefull for want of the Language and we 
think this the most likely means to save others the charge and trouble of 
a long voyage, as well as the mortification of being disapointed in their 
expectations.

Dear Sir 

I am favoured wth yours of the loth. and as far as Time will permit 
Shall reply to the several Matters therein hinted. 

With respect to General Arnold, he is considered by Congress as a brave 
and deserving Officer, and had it been possible to have proceeded in the 
line of Succession in appointing officers would undoubtedly have been 
promoted. This cannot be done withÂ°. giving great Dissatisfaction to the 
States that had no officers in the army in the beginning of the War ; who 
claim a Right to their proportion, agreable to the Number of Men wch. 
they furnish for the Service, of Major and Brig. Generals. The principles 
of appointmt. are therefore reduced to three Heads, and a Regard will be 
had to each of these, " the present Rank of the officers, their Merit, and 
the proportion already mentioned ", and upon the two first I think General 
Arnold will meet a timely promotion.^ 

I am informed that upon a report of the Board of War upon your 
Brother's Letter, Congress discovered a Resentment at the disrespectful 
Freedom expressed therein, and would not consent to give him a Comm. 
of an earlier Date. I think he had a Right to his Claim, but cannot 
altogether approve of the Stile in which he addressed the Legislative 
authority of the Continent. It is the fixed Determination of Congress to 
preserve the civil above the military, and the authority of that will not be 
surrendered, should it be necessary to disband the army in preserving the 
same. Your Friends will endeavour to reconcile the Matter, and if Meas-

Dear Sir, 

We have this clay received Letters from Europe, of an interesting 
Nature.^ We are under Injunctions of Silence concerning one very im- 
portant Point : and indeed I don't know how far I am at Liberty concern- 
ing some others : but thus much I may venture to communicate : That We 
have an offer of three Millions of Livres in Specie, without Interest, and 
to be paid when We shall be settled in Peace and Independence ; that all 
Europe wish Us well, excepting only Portugal and Russia ; that all the 
Ports of France and Spain and Italy and all the Ports in the Mediter- 
ranean, excepting Portugal, are open to our Privateers and Merchant 
Ships. That there is no danger of our wanting Arms or Ammunition for 
the future â€” between six and seven hundred Barrells of Powder having 
arrived in Maryland, and indeed, We had plenty of Powder before. In 
short, my Friend, altho We have many grievous Things to bear, and shall 
have more; yet there is nothing wanting but Patience. Patience and 
Perseverance, will carry Us through this mighty Enterprize â€” an Enter- 
prize that is and will be an Astonishment to vulgar Minds all over the 
World, in this and in future Generations. An Enterprize however, which, 
Faithfullness to our Ancestors who have sett Us Examples of Resistance 
to Tyranny, Faithfullness to the present and future Generations, whose 
Freedom depend upon it laid us under every moral and religious obliga- 
tion to undertake. Our Accounts from Europe are that great Prepara- 
tions are making for War and that every Thing tends to that Object, but 
when or where, or how Hostilities will commence is yet unknown. France 
and Spain, will act in concert and with perfect Amity, neither will take 
any Step without the other. 

The American Ministers abroad, advise Us to exert ourselves in every 
Respect, as if We were to receive no Assistance from abroad. This is 
certainly good Advice and if We have Wisdom enough to follow it, a 
Division by a War in Europe will be a more effectual Relief to us.' 
I am, etc.

Sir 

I received your favour of the 20th Ultimo, am sorry to hear that the 
recruiting service goes on so slow in Connecticut at this time when we 
ought to have an Army in the Field sufficient to subdue the Enemy. 
General Gates is ordered to Tycondaroga. he sets out to morrow. It is 
not determined what other General officers are to be sent there. General 
St Clair is talked of for one.^ Congress has this Day passed some resolu- 
tions for regulating the payment of the army which are ordered to be 
published in the News Papers. The Pay of the Assistant Paymasters in 
the Northern Department was this Day augmented to forty Dollars per 
month and 3 rations per Day. The Pay of the Regimental Paymasters 
is the same â€” that was fixed last Saturday the 29th Ult.^ We have Letters 
from our Ambassadors at Foreign Courts as late as the 27th of January. 
The accounts are favourable beyond our expectation, they have been 
offered the loan of large sums of money without Interest to be repaid 
when these States shall be settled in Peace. It was not certainly known 
wiiether a war would soon take place between France and Great Britain, 
tho' very probable.* .... 

I shall move to have a further supply of Money immediately sent to 
Albany.^ I should think it advisable for you to return there as soon as 
your affairs will admit.

Deputy Commissary General (who is a very honest discreet man) is 
directed to purchase and store sufficient quantities of those articles and 
have them ready to deliver to your order ^ the highest price he had given 
for Corn when he wrote was half a Dollar per Bushel. Much depends 
upon your employing none but persons of Strict Integrity, and great 
prudence and discretion in your department otherwise the greatest Frauds 
and peculation may take place, your Credit, and I fear the public Interest 
has suffered much from your employing a Gentleman in this place to pur- 
chase provisions, there are great Complaints against him that he gives 
very exorbitant prices and that the prices of articles have been much 
increased by his indiscretion I have no personal knowledge of these things 
but they are publicly talked of by persons of the best Credit. Congress did 
not think proper to displace him because he is your Deputy and you 
accountable for his conduct, but the President was twice directed by Con- 
gress to inform you of the complaints. Mr Wharton is the person. 
Enclosed is a Copy of an Advertisement Posted up by one of his Deputies.' 
It is said that last winter Mr Wharton made public declaration in this 
City that he was employed to purchased a large Quantity of Rum for the 
Army and the highest price would be given, and that he gave like notice 
to the people in the Country as to the purchase of Pork and Beef and other 
provisions. I don't know on what terms you employ people but sure I am 
it will not do to employ them to purchase on Commissions unless you limit 
the prices : For the greater prices they give the more will be their profits, 
which is such a temptation as an honest man would not wish to be 
led into.* 

A Gentleman at Baltimore has made proposals for supplying the army 
by Contract at a certain price per ration not to risque more than his own 
time and trouble. He has also proposed another plan by which all the 
provisions for the Army and those purchased for exportation either by 
the public or private merchants should go through the same hands, so 
that they may govern the prices by not interfering one with another, a 
Copy of both are Enclosed I wish to have your opinion on them and 
whether you would be willing to undertake in either way. I am one of 
a Committee to whom it is referred. Mr Smith of Baltimore and Mr 
Gerry are the other two we thought it not best to do any thing upon it 
'till we knew your thoughts on the Subject. I wish you would write to me 
whether you think either of those ways preferable to the present rnode.^

Philadelphia, 6 April, 1777. 

You have had many rumors propagated among you which I suppo>e 
you know not how to account for. One was, that Congress, the last 
summer, had tied the hands of General Washington, and would not let him 
fight, particularly on the White plains. This report was totally ground- 
less. Another was, that at last, Congress untied the General, and then he 
instantly fought and conquered at Trenton. This also was without 
foundation, for as his hands were never tied, so they were not untied. 
Indeed, within a few days past, a question has been asked Congress, to the 
surprise, I believe, of every member there, w'hether the General was bound 
by the advice of a council of war? No member of Congress, that I know 
of, ever harbored or conceived such a thought. " Taking the advice of 
a council of war " are the words of the General's instructions, but this 
meant only, that councils of war should be called and their opinions and 
reasons demanded, but the General, like all other commanders of armies, 
was to pursue his own judgment after all." 

Another report, which has been industriously circulated, is, that the 
General has been made by Congress, dictator. But this is as false as the 
other stories. Congress, it is true, upon removing to Baltimore, gave the 
General power to raise fifteen battalions, in addition to those which were 
ordered to be raised before, and to appoint the officers, and also, to raise 
three thousand horse, and to appoint their officers, and also, to take neces- 
saries for his army, at an appraised value. But no more. Congress never 
thought of making him dictator, or of giving him a sovereignty.^ I wish 
I could find a correspondent, who was idle enough to attend to every 
report, and write it to me. Such false news, uncontradicted, does more 
or less harm. Such a collection of lies w'ould be a curiosity for posterity. 

The report you mention in your last, that the British administration 
had proposed to Congress a treaty and terms, is false, and without a color. 
On the contrary, it is now more than ever past a doubt, that their fixed 
determination is, conquest and unconditional subjugation. But there w^ll 
be many words and blows too, before they will accomplish their wishes. 
Poor, abandoned, infatuated nation ! Infatuation is one of the causes to 
which great historians ascribe many events, and if it ever produced any 
effect, it has produced this war against America

I'liiLADELriiiA, April 6, 1777 
My Friend, 

The Business of the naval and marine Department will I hope be soon 
put in a better Train than it has been. A Board of Assistants has been 
appointed here consisting^ of three Gentlemen, not Members of Cong^ress, 
whose whole Time is devoted to the Service, Mr. Ilopkinson, Coll. Nixon 
and Mr. John Wharton are the Men. The first is a Gentleman of Letters, 
the second an able Merchant, the third an eminent shipwright.^ 

There is a Talk off appointing a similar Board at Boston and a Com- 
missioner at every considerable Port in N. England. Who would be 
proper Persons for those Places? They should be well acquainted with 
Navigation. They should be well informed in Trade. They should be 
Men of Character and Credit.' 

The Marine Committee have lately reed. Letters from Captn Thomp- 
son, McNeal * and several others, pointing out Defects, Abuses and Mis- 
managements, and proposing Plans of Improvement, Redress and Refor- 
mation. These will do good. This is the Way to have things go right ; 
for Officers to correspond constantly with Congress and communicate 
their Sentiments freely.^ ....

5 Another letter from Adams to Warren, written in the evening of the same 
day (Warren-Adams Letters, I. 310), discusses marine affairs, and should be read 
in connection with this letter. Following is the significant part of it : 

" Complaints are frequently brought here from Boston and from Providence con- 
cerning the Continental Agents and other Officers. T am sorry for this, but cannot help 
it. At Providence I fear, by what I have lately heard, there has been a System of 
Selfishness, and at Boston of Incapacity. I had the Honour of belonging to the first 
Naval Committee, which set all our maritime agoing ; and they did it with a Vigour, 
Assiduity and Dispatch, which precluded all Censure and Complaint : But I went home 
last December was twelve Month, and Advantage was taken of that Opportunity, one or 
two other Members being absent at the same Time â€” Coll. Lee went home, and Gadsden 
and Langdon and Deane was left out â€” to choose a new Committee. Since which 
there has been nothing but Languor, Censure and Complaint. Upon my Return they did 
me the Honour to put me upon the Board of War, which takes up my whole Time, 
every Morning and Evening, and renders it totally impossible for me to look into the 
marine Department, which if I had Leisure to do, ignorant as I am of every Rope in the 
Ship, I would perish if I did not put that Department in a respectable order. There 
is nothing wanting but some one Person whose Vigour, Punctuality, and Constancy, should 
draw the Committee together every morning and Evening, direct their Attention to the 

Object, and keep it fixed there The Fracas between Manley and McNeal had 

reached this Place before your Letter, hope it will do good." (C/. Warren-Adams 
Letters, L 304, 311. 3I2, 317, 319. 329, 350, 372; also no. 624, post.) 

Adams appears thus early to have fallen into some errors of recollection as regards 
the marine committee. Similar errors found in his autobiographical statements, written 
many years later, have been pointed out in the preceding volume of these Letters (see 
vol. I., no. 316, note 3. and no. 390, note 2), where the principal stages in the develop- 
ment of the marine committee are mentioned. Adams was probablj' a member of the

The declaration of independance was said to have divided and weak- 
ened the colonies. The contrary of this was the case. Nothing but the 

created Dec. 14. (In the appendix to the Journals, vol. VI.. the committee of Dec. 11 
is erroneously given as the standing marine committee.) Of this committee Adams 
was not a member, for he had taken his leave Dec. 9. Adams seems to have confused 
the creation of the new committee, Dec. 14, with the filling of vacancies. Mar. 6, 1776. 
Moreover, he is in error in suggesting that he was absent when these vacancies were 
filled; he had returned to Congress Feb. 9. John Langdon was a member with Adams 
of the earlier naval committee (he was appointed Oct. 13, 1775). but was not a member 
of the standing marine committee.

enemies much the most dangerous. The people on the New Hampshire

The movement toward a reform of the medical department began with the criticisms 
of Doctors Morgan and Stringer and their dismission by Congress. See the Journals, 
Jan. 9, and no. 298. ante. The Journals evidently fail to record some of the essential 
stages in the progress of the measure. On Feb. 27 the medical committee, " to whom 
the report on the hospital was re-committed ", reported a measure, apparently drawn by 
Benjamin Rush, which is printed in the Journals under that date. The immediate origin 
of this report was a plan prepared by Doctors Shippen and Cochran and transmitted 
to Congress by General Washington in a letter of Feb. 14, received by Congress Feb. 20, 
and referred to the medical committee. When a report of the committee was recom- 
mitted the Journals do not show. Probably the report of the medical committee Feb. 
14, which was laid on the table, " to be taken into consideration tomorrow ", was a 
report on the hospital. The report of Feb. 27, ordered to lie on the table, was taken into 
consideration Mar. 22, and recommitted. Mar. 24 a new plan was brought in. John 
Adams wrote to John Avery, jr., Mar. 21: "We are making every regulation in our 
power in the medical department" (Works, IX. 458). 

5 " Congress is now full. Every one of the thirteen States has a representation 
in it, which has not happened before in a long time." John Adams to his wife, Apr. 11

come that he might return home. Mar. 22 he wrote to his wife that Governor Trumbull 
had twice signified lately that Dyer and Williams were coming, and he presumed those 
gentlemen were in earnest (Conn. Hist. Soc, Oliver Wolcott Papers, II. 36). Apr. 9 
(the same day on which Sherman's letter was written) he wrote : " It is said that Col. 
Dyer and Williams will soon be here if so my continuance will not be supposed neces- 
sary and I shall therefore consider it as merely Optionable and shall do what I judge 
may be proper." (Ibid., II. 41.) Cf. no. 442, post.

432. Committee of Congress to George Washington.' 

Philadelphia April 10, 1777 

In obedience to an order of Congress * we inform your Excellency of 
the reasons and principles that have governed Congress in their resolu- 
tion for forming a Camp on the West side of Delaware. The repeated 
information that hath been received of the Enemies movements and it 
being the opinion of your Excellency as well as of many other General 
Officers that this City was the Object of such Movements, rendered it 
proper that means should be fallen upon to prevent the success of such a 
design, as well to guard against the bad impression that it would certainly 
have on the affairs of America in general, as to give security to the valu- 
able Stores here collected, and which cannot speedily be removed. It has 
been considered, that if the real Object of the enemy should be this City, 
the Troops are here well fixed, and will be an encouraging place of resort 
to the Militia of this State, in their present unfixt condition, being between 
their old plan of Association, and their new but yet unexecuted Law. On 
the other hand, should the design of the enemy be upon Hudsons river or 
more Eastward, the Troops here may with ease reach that river before 
those, now at Head Quarters, can have all crossed it. But another con- 
sideration remains, and that is. should the enemy propose to remain in 
Jersey to attack your Army, or should your Excellency mean to make a 
dicisive impression on them when your numbers are sufficient, in either 
of these suppositions, the Troops ought not to be here. 

In the whole of this business. Congress mean not in any manner to inter- 
fere with the designs, or to counter act the judgment of your Excellency, 
but wish you freely to call up to Head Quarters, all. or any part of the 
Troops encampt here as you shall please. It is not supposed that this will 
occasion any delay, and will certainly prevent the injuries that would be 
derived to the Troops, as well in health as dicipline from their entering 
and remaining any time in this City.

Troops had better march to Head Quarters quick as possible, you have 
only so to order it, and it will give pleasure to every good man here. The 
business of speedily reenforcing you will not be obstructed, but accelirated, 
because they now enter the City, where every days stay is 30 days injury 
to the great purpose of strengthening your hands. And should the 
enemy destine here, something like a Military collection may produce a 
greater resort. If you will indulge my conjecture, I think they cannot 
purpose coming here, because the water securities against such a plan are 
realy formidable, and the situation of the land, where the water obstruc- 
tions are fixed, is such, that great delay, and probable ruin forbids the 
enterprise, as they cannot so fix land Batteries as to remove the strong 
Vessels that protect the cheveaux dc frise, added to the numerous fire

Philadelphia, April loth, 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

Yesterday it was agreed in Congress that the subject of the Articles of 
Confederacy should be taken up on Monday next, and that two days in 
each week should be employed therein, until that work should be com- 
pleted.^ As this is a matter of the utmost importance, it is certainly neces- 
sary that our State should be fully represented, especially as I am by no 
means competent to the task. I therefore most ardently wish you would 
give your attendance in Congress, and beg you would write to Mr. Van 
Dyke, pressing his immediate repair hither. I am in a most disagreeable 
situation, a stranger to every person, unable to speak my sentiments in 
Congress, and no colleague to confer with on any subject that may con- 
cern our State. There has already a matter been determined which, I am 
afraid, will throw the whole county of Sussex into confusion and disorder: 
I think it is the report from the Board of War that an independent com- 
pany shall be raised in that county, to be stationed at Lewistown, that 
Harry Fisher shall have the command; [and] if he refuse, he shall have 
at least the appointment of the subaltern officers. This was brought in 
immediately on my taking my seat in Congress, and though I utterly dis- 
approved the measure, as far as respected Fisher, I could not open my 
mouth in objection.^ This, sir, shows the necessity of some person being 
here who has the inclination and power to object to and show the im-

which the Journals contain no further record of him. Read appears to have made an 
effort in December to prevail upon him to give his attendance again in Congress (see 
Life of Read, pp. 263, 287), but there is no record that he ever showed his face there 
again. In regard to Henry Fisher, see the letter of George Read to Robert Morris,

propriety of such appointments. 1 am totally unfit for it, and am miser- 
able on tiie occasion. 

From what we hear from hea(l-(|uarters it seems to be the prevailing 
opinion that the enemy intend to [move] to Philadelphia in a very short 
time, tiiat the licet are comiiip^ into the river, and that boats are preparing 
for the army to cross the same. 

I should be exceedingly sorry to press you upon a subject that I know 
at this time is disagreeable, I mean your attendance here ; but it appears 
to me to be indispensably necessary to our State that you should be in 
Congress: with respect to myself it is so much so that without your 
attendance I cannot think of staying, â€” alone I will not. I hope you will 
excuse this incoherent scrawl. Please to present my best compliments to 
Mrs. Read. It would give me great pleasure to receive a line from you.

My dear sir 

In considering a Letter from the General, Sometime ago, in the Board 
of War. it was agreed to report to Congress a Resolution, approving of 
the Laboratory at Sprin[g] field, and Such a Report was made, but upon 
some opposition to it, it was orderd to lye on the Table, where it has lain 
ever since.^ I wmII move to have it taken up and determined. Some 
Gentlemen will oppose it, particularly the President, I believe, thinking 
Brookfield the best Place. I am not very clear myself, that it is the best, 
but from a greater Confidence in the Opinion of General Washington and 
General Knox, than in my own, I voted for it, and shall continue to do so.'

by the by that several bills from Mr. Treasurer Ashe came to hand before 
your warrant, and they were paid on my giving my ai)probation.^ 

I laid the intelligence you gave me relative to Indian affairs before the 
Congress, who were just then in deliberation on that subject. Gen. Hand, 
an experienced officer, is ordered to the frontier to direct the necessary 
operations for their defence. He has directions to embody the militia of 
Pennsylvania and Virginia in such numbers and divisions as he shall find 
necessary, and to repel, or invade the Indians if the circumstances of the 
war require it. you will be startled at this power : but it was given at 
the request of Pennsylvania and Virginia, whose peculiar circumstances 
had made it necessary.^ Your vigilance, Sir, has anticipated any measures 
necessary for the security of our frontiers, and as I am better satisfied to 
rely on your powers for all the exertions of our State, than to admit 
extraordinary interpositions ^^ of Congress. I contented myself with marely 
assenting to the measures recommended by Pennsylvania and Virginia, 
without requiring them to extend to us. While our own militia is to 
perform the services, I believe it will be also agreeable to my country, as 
well as to me, that they should be under the command of their own officers^ 
and under the direction of our own magistrates, especially while your Ex- 
cellency presides. When I am to consent to the contrary, it must be under 
express instructions, or when inevitable and very sudden necessity allows 
no time to consult, and no choice of alternatives ; and even then I should 
rely on such circumstances to excuse me to candid constituents, but not to 
justify me to this tribunal 

In your favour of the i6th you have prophesied what has since in a 
great measure come to pass. All particular jealousies are for the present 
laid to sleep, and long and uninterrupted may their slumber be. We are 
more wisely employed in giving vigor to our military operations, and in 
correcting abuses in our department [s] 

I am very much concerned for the apprehensions you express relative 
to the indolence of our officers. Many abuses are complained of from 
every quarter in the recruiting service, and it is at length found to proceed 
from the idea that the civil power of the States had no control over them. 
This is what I had suggested very soon after my arrival at Congress,* but 
it was always reluctantly listened to, until the abuse was complained of 
from many quarters, and attributed to the same cause. I brought in a

Resolution for corrcctiii}^ the abuse through the interventions of the 
States, and was very happy in fintHng no oi)i)osition made on the old 
ground. It produced a reference to a Committee, and the result was the 
Resolutions which the President transmits to you, and of which the 
inclosed is a copy. I doubt not your vigorous exertions to root out all 
the evils in that department, which may be found in the State over which 
you preside. The Resolution, with resi:)ect to servants was originally 
followed by a clause, requiring compensation to be made to owners and 
masters ; but it fell through, on an equal division ; those voting against it, 
who were most interested in the affirmative. The day (Viz 15th May) 
is not well calculated for your State : but that Resolution is expected and 
intended to have its effect in the States, nearer to the field of action, and 
that day was deemed remote enough for that purpose. Upon the whole, 
Sir, I hope it will every where have as great effect as it can.*^ We have 
for a few days been alarmed here, tho', I believe without foundation. No 
consternation followed upon this occasion, but measures were calmly 
taken to oppose the enemy. The Congress are sensible of the impropriety 
of their last flight, and I believe they will not again fall into the like error. 
I have added all in my power to confirm them in this disposition, and the 
timid members have encountered such poignant ridicule from many 
quarters, that I believe they deem the approach of the enemy less formid- 
able than another series of like encounters. I, for my own part, intend 
to stay in the city, and give my best assistance for its defence, unless it 
shall be determined to abandon it altogether.Â® ....

Stile. The Character of New England is concerned in the execution of 
it. I hope in God, that little Banditti of the Halt and blind in Rhode 

Island will be destroyed in all events if it costs us Thousands of 

Lives it ought to be done. But I believe by an expedition prudently con- 
ducted they may be driven off or made Prisoners without any considerable 
Loss.^

Committee of Correspondence and to which beg your refference,^ besides 

had drawn attention to himself by his pamphlet Common Sense. Following an account 
of the appearance of Paine's pamphlet and a discussion of its effect, John Adams 
relates in his Autobiography (Works, II. 509) something of the circumstances of his 
appointment : 

" Notwithstanding these doubts, I felt myself obliged to Paine for the pains he had 
taken, and for his good intentions to serve us, which I then had no doubt of. I saw 
he had a capacity and a ready pen ; and, understanding he was poor and destitute, I 
thought we might put him into some employment where he might be useful and earn 
a living. Congress appointed a Committee of Foreign Affairs, not long after, and they 
wanted a clerk. I nominated Thomas Paine, supposing him a ready writer and an 
industrious man. Dr. Witherspoon, the President of New Jersey College, and then 
a delegate from that State, rose and objected to it with an earnestness that surprised 
me. The Doctor said he would give his reasons ; he knew the man and his communica- 
tion ; when he first came over, he was on the other side, and had written pieces against 
the American cause; that he had afterwards been employed by his friend, Robert 
Aitkin, and finding the tide of popularity run rapidly, he had turned about ; that he was 
very intemperate, and could not write until he had quickened his thoughts with large 
draughts of rum and water; that he was, in short, a bad character, and not fit to be 
placed in such a situation. General Roberdeau spoke in his favor ; no one confirmed 
Witherspoon's account, though the truth of it has since been sufficiently established. 
Congress appointed him ; but he w-as soon obnoxious by his manners, and dismissed."

Dear Sir 

Mr. Morris to Day put into my Hands your Lre. to him of the 1st. of 
April in which You express the general Sense that prevailed in the State 
of Maryland respectinj;^ the leaving a Battallion in Somersett County, that 
it would conduce much to the general Interest would keep the three Coun- 
ties inclined to Toryism in Order and eventually save the Effusion of 
much Blood as well as a heavy Expcncc. 

I moved in Consequence thereof that Genl. Smallwood should be 
ordered to station a Battallion there to be under the Direction of the Ex- 
ecutive Power of the State of Maryland untill removed or otherwise 
ordered by Congress. 

On Debate the Sense of the House seemed to be that None of the 
Troops already raised could be spared but that a new Battallion might be 
raised on continental Pay and Expence for that Purpose and have directed 
a Comittee to bring in a Report on the Subject composed of Colo Duer

Sir 

The Letter from the Convention relative to the Insurgents in 

the North Eastern Parts of the State, transmitted to Mr. Lewis Morris 

before my arrival has been read in Congress ; but as I expected daily the 

arrival of Mr. Duane and Mr. Livingston I thought it most prudent to 

get the Consideration postponed, to which Congress acceded. 

The Deputies from New Connecticut are now in Town, and have 
presented to Congress a Memorial, a Copy of which I shall do myself the 
Honor to transmit you in a Day or two. I can by no Means think that 
this Attempt to dismember our State will be countenanced by Congress, 
tho', I am sorry to say that, I can very easily perceive that Individuals 
from the Eastern States mean to support Messrs. Aliens in their extrava- 
gant Pretensions. I flatter myself however that with the Assistance of 
my Colleagues, I shall procure such Resolutions passed as will reprobate 
their Proceedings and oblige the revolted Subjects to render a due obedi- 
ence to the Laws of the State.^ 

I am extremely sorry to inform you that notwithstanding the Invasion 
which threatens this City, a Langour prevails amongst the Inhabitants of 
almost all Ranks. The Disputes about their Constitution, and a Want of 
vigilance and Vigour in detecting and defeating the Designs of the dis- 
affected have given the Malignants a dangerous ascendancy. The Depre- 
ciation of the Continental Money is astonishingly rapid, and I see with 
Concern that no attempts are made to check so fatal a Measure. You 
will observe by the inclosed Resolution of Congress of the 14th and 15th 
April, that they have been under the necessity of supplying an executive 
authority in this State. By the Recess of the Supreme Executive Council, 
there was an absolute Interregnum, and if Congress had not interposed, 
this State would have fallen an easy prey to a very small Body of the 
Enemy's army. It is to be hoped however that the authority now estab- 
lished will exert itself with Vigour, and that a little Quackery will save a

powerful State wliich inust have fallen a Sacritice to a speculative System 
of politicks." .... 

The slow progress made in the Recruiting Business, notwithstanding 
the favorable Accounts which were at first circulated, has at length roused 
Congress, and they have entered into sundry Resolutions, for compleating 
the Battalions, which I have the Honor to transmit.* It is with pleasure 
that I consider that the State, to which I have the Honor to belong, has 
pointed out to Congress the most eligible and effectual Mode of completing 
the army." Would to Heaven that the Spirit and activity, which has of 
late animated the Councils of the State of New York would diffuse itself 
throughout the other States ! A portion of their Electrical Fire is certainly 
wanting. Without it, should the Enemy receive a timely Reinforcement 
and shew the least Spirit of Enterprize, our affairs must inevitably suffer. 
.... Mr. Duane and Mr. Livingston, who arrived here yesterday, desire 
me to tender their respects to the Convention. 

" .-K committee was appointed Apr. 9 to consider the steps necessary to be taken 
to oppose the enemy, and it was instructed to confer with the executive powers of 
Pennsylvania. This committee made its report Apr. 10. Apr. 11 a committee was 
appointed to take measures, in conjunction with the board of war of Pennsylvania, to 
prevent the provisions in Philadelphia from falling into the hands of the enemy. This 
committee, consisting of William Duer, Samuel Adams, and Abraham Clark, made a 
report, Apr. 14, which relates, not to provisions in Philadelphia, but to executive authority 
in the state. In accordance with the recommendation of this committee another com- 
mittee was appointed to confer on the subject with the supreme executive council of the 
state. The latter committee consisted of Samuel Adams, William Duer, and Richard 
Henry Lee ; that is, the membership was the same as that of the preceding committee, 
except that Richard Henry Lee took the place of Clark and that Samuel Adams was 
chairman instead of Duer. This committee held the conference Apr. 15 and made its 
report to Congress the same day. 

An extract from the minutes of Apr. 15, printed in Pa. Arch., first ser., V. 311, con- 
tains, besides a few minor variations from the journal record, the following minutes 
not found in the Journals: 

" That a Conference agreeable to the order of Congress, hcis been held, when the 
following Gentlemen were present : 

" His Excellency Thomas Wharton, jun. Esquire, President of the Supreme Executive 
Council. 

" Board of War. Owen Biddle, Esq., Chairman, Joseph Dean, Richard Bache, John 
Shee. 

" Delegates for the State of Pennsylvania in Congress. Robert Morris, James Wilson, 
Daniel Roberdeau. George Clymer, Esquires. 

" Committee of Congress. Mr. Samuel Adams, Mr. Richard H. Lee, Mr. Duer." 

In the first paragraph of the committee's report as printed in the Journals (Apr. 15, 
p. 268) an "and" is erroneously bracketed in the clause: "at the particular instance 
and request of the president [and] of the supreme executive council ". The meaning 
is that the request came from the president of the supreme executive coimcil of 
Pennsylvania. The committee appointed (Apr. 9) to confer with the board of war of 
Pennsylvania speaks, in the preamble of its report (Apr. 14, p. 263), of " the adjournment 
of the legislative and executive authority of the commonwealth ", and the committee 
which was appointed Apr. 14 and reported Apr. 15 was " to confer with the president 
of the supreme executive coimcil, with such other members of the said council as can 
be convened ", etc. The record of the conference quoted above shows that of the council 
only the president attended the conference. What appears to be a draft of a letter 
from President Wharton to some members of the council requesting their attendance 
at the conference is in Pa. Arch., first ser., V. 312. Cf. nos. 432. 433. 440, ante, 453, 455,

Sir 

We Yesterday moved for a Copy of the Representation from our 
revolted Subjects, to Congress. A Member from the Massachusetts would 
have made it a Condition that a Copy of your Remonstrance should be 
delivered to him, for the Use of the Revolters, insisting that we and they 
were perfectly on an equal Footing, stiling us the parties etc. This 
brought on some altercation, not to the Advantage of this open and 
avowed Advocate for the Disturbers of the public peace and general 
Union. In the Conclusion, the paper we moved for w^as ordered to be 
delivered. On our parts we assured the House, that tho' we should not 
suffer the State of New York to be put on a Level with a small part of 
its disaftected Subjects, yet we had no Secret on this Occasion; that any 
Member had our free Consent to take a Copy, and make such Use of it 
as he might think proper. Here it ended. ^ 

We have obtained and transmit a Copy of a printed address from 
Doctor Young to the Insurgents in our State, in which he positively asserts 
that he has taken the Minds of several of the leading Members of Congress 
and then proceeds to give them their advice. This paper, corresponding 
with the Hints we had from the Committee sent into Cumberland, renders 
it unnecessary to trouble you about further proof. Doctor Young is on 
the Spot, if he has injured his Friends they have the Means of ample 
Satisfaction, for they can call him before the House. However, we do not 
observe that the Imputation gives any Uneasiness to the suspected Mem- 
bers, tho' w^e are well assured, it has made strong Impressions to their 
Disadvantage on the Minds of other Gentlemen, What Notice Conven- 
tion ought to take of this insolent Address does not lie w'ith us to deter- 
mine ; nor have we yet concluded on the part we shall pursue in Congress.^

April, ijj-j 337 

It is our Business to move deliberately, as, from the Change of Members 
we find ourselves surrounded with Strangers. To cultivate their Esteem 
and good opinion is of Moment, considering the unfriendly views of some 
States and the Magnitude of the Business committed to our Charge. 

A Committee, consisting of a Member from each State, is appointed to 
examine into the Conduct of General Schuyler. It was not done without 
warm opposition. There was no Accuser no Complaint, no Charge 
against the General. Nothing had ever been said to his Disadvantage or 
Dishonor in that House : directing the Enquiry was an implied Censure, 
or at least an Indication of Suspicion, which should be avoided. These 
were the Arguments against the appointment of a Committee, a single 
Remark was sufficient to refute them. If the General had done his Duty 
faithfully, why was his authority pared away to Nothing and the Com- 
mand of the Army, in Effect, transferred from him to General Gates, a 
Junior officer? We can entertain no Apprehension, but that the General 
will be honorably acquited, tho' it is obvious enough that pains have been 
taken to injure his Character.* 

The feeble inactive Condition of Pennsylvania is a sad proof how little 
their new Constitution is calculated for Security or Defence in Time of 
Danger. Their executive Authority appear to be sensible of their Weak- 
ness and lean with their whole weight upon Congress, who have found it 
necessary to recommend a temporary System, to prevent the Ruin of the 
Cause, as far as it is connected with this State.^ to this will be added a 
Recommendation to revive the General Committees, for Nothing can be 
substituted in the place of this Institution equally salutary, or which can 
produce so much Union Energ}^ and Vigour. The Spirit of the Legisla- 
ture under the new Constitution here is strongly marked in their Militia 
Act which provides that if a Colonel or other officer shall strike a Soldier 
while upon Duty he shall forfeit a sum not less than five nor more than 
ten pounds, but if the Soldier shall strike or draw upon his Colonel or 
other officer while on Duty he shall be fined a Sum not exceeding Â£ 5 ! 

We beg leave to assure you Sir, that we shall exert our most zealous 
Endeavors for the Interest and Honor of our State on every Occasion : 
and it gives us singular pleasure that your honorable Body maintain a 
high Rank in the Estimation of Congress, as well as of the General and 
army, which cannot but greatly contribute to our Success in every just 
and reasonable Measure. We have the Honor to be with the utmost 
Regard Sir

.... The Enemv have for some time threatened this Citv, and have 
made Preparations which induce our best Generals to think their principal 
Attack will be against this Place. On Sunday the 13th. nine of their Men 
of War came into this Bay, which confirmed in great Measure the Infor- 
mation we had before received. Some Days before that Congress had 
ordered a Camp to be formed under Genl. Schuyler upon the West Side 
of Delaware for three Reasons, That the Soldiers, of whom there were a 
considerable Number in the City, might be drawn togather so as to be 
ready to oppose any sudden Attempt upon the City 'til the main Army 
could come up ; that they would be more healthy in Camp than in Town ; 
that they would support the Militia which might come in ; that they would 
be able to reach the North River, if the Attack of the Enemy should be 
made there, before the rest of the Army could cross ; and that they could 
speedily join the General to execute any Plan which he [might] form in 
the Jersey. After all they were left to the General's Direction to order 
where he pleased.^ He in Part approves of the Measure, and has ordered 
the Camp to be formed at Bristol where all the troops that come from the

My dear Sir, 

The enclosed resolve is now sent, principally with a view of rectifying 
some Typhographic errors that the copy formerly sent you contained.^ 
I am again in the name of Congress to desire your Excellency will detain 
the flour in Virginia, until further directions, that Mr. Commissary

My dear Sir 

.... I heartily concur with you in regreting the abominable Practice 
of prophane Swearing in our Army. It is indeed alarming. Congress 
has repeatedly injoynd the General officers to discountenance this Practice 
by their Authority and Influence, you know my Abhorrence of it, and 
may depend upon my exerting the utmost of my Endeavors, if possible, 
to root it out of the Army.^ .... The medical Department is now put 
upon a new footing and Rules are establishing in the Quarter Masters for 
keeping our Soldiers cleanly in their Encampments whereby their Health 
as well as Lives will be preservd.' .... 

Congress a few Days ago determind to establish a ]Marine Board in 
the Eastern Department to consist of three Members who are to reside 
in or near Boston with the Power of adjourning to any other place. They 
are to be subject to the Directions of the Marine Conimittee of Congress. 

been the Case for some time ; they have now nine Men of War in the Bay, and are 
making Preparations at N. York and Amboy, which most of us Generals think are 
intended against Philadelphia. I believe they are too weak to succeed, but if they do, 
I am of Opinion they will ruin this Army, which is at this time very small and is 
mouldering away by Sickness. We are too weak to take advantage of their Situation. 
Ten thousand Men at this time would go near to finish the War. If the different 
Legislative and Executive Powers upon the Continent will enforce the late Resolutions 
of Congress, we may yet be free ; we may collect a respectable Army, and upon that 
depends our Salvation as a People. Britain begins to totter, her Trade is cut off and 
her Merchants become Bankrupt .... We attend Congress from ten to four, and 
meet in Com. at six." Library of Congress, Personal.

this Board with a Salary of 1500 Dollars per Annum each. A Number of 
Gentlemen of the Massachusetts had been nominated by the Members of

Gentlemen of Connecticutt and Rhode Island were urgent, it would not 
have been prudent for us to have been strenuous for the Choice of all out

better Choice. Mr Warren's Character has long been revered in Con-

We have received your Honrs. letter of the i6th instant by Mr Brown. 
Your letter to Congress was also received and read yesterday, and referred 
to the Committee for Foreign Affairs.^ .... Congress was not disposed 
to censure the Eastern States for giving additional bounties, supposing 
them to be the best judges of the expediency of the measure.* The Com- 
mittees of the Middle States did nothing as to regulating prices, they 
being equally divided in opinion respecting the matter.* The prices of 
almost all kinds of articles are very high here. The Commissary General 
arrived here yesterday, and a committee is appointed to confer with him 
and consider what further regulations ought to be made in his depart- 
ment. Â° 

.... I am sorry there is occasion to call the militia to joyn the army. 
I think it would be unnecessary if the men inlisted were collected together. 
What is recommended respecting Rhode-Island, it was hoped, would not 
detain the militia for a very long time after their assembling.Â® ....

Invasion, seems to be a distant Object. The Seat of this Disease is not 
an Indifiference to the Cause, for the Whigs are sufficiently numerous to 
defend their Country against any Army that can at present be brought 
against it. The unhappy Dispute about their Constitution is the fatal 
Rock on which they have split, and which threatens them with Destruc- 
tion. We ardently wish that in our own State the utmost Caution may be 
used to avoid a like Calamitv. Everv wise Man here wishes that the 
Establishment of new Forms of Government had been deferred : they see 
that the Union, Vigour, and Security derived from Conventions and Com- 
mittees are not to be found in any State under its new Constitution. 

We have hitherto left the Subject of our Instructions untouched, but 
in the Course of a few Days they shall be introduced. To become 
acquainted with the persons and Characters of the Members requires 
some Time and is of great Importance. We find several of our House 
desirous to know the Merits of our Claim. Congress, from your past 
Letters have a Right to expect a Representation, and w^e wait with Im- 
patience for the Reports and Maps, to elucidate our Boundary.^ ....

465. Thomas Burke to the Governor of North Carolina 

(Richard Caswell) ^ 

Philadelphia, April 29th 1777. 

Sir'. 

An express going hence to Charlestown gives me an opportunity of 
writing you a few lines, but without being able to communicate any thing 
interesting. 

We have at present in Congress a representation of all the Colonies, 
altho' the number of Delegates is not very considerable. New York enter- 
tains the most virulent jealousy against her Eastern Neighbours, and it is 
now heightened by an affair which is something embarrassing. The 
inhabitants of what is usually called the New Hampshire Grants, have 
attempted to set up a distinct State, and sent Delegates to Congress to 
claim a seat. New York remonstrated: the new State (called New Con- 
necticut) seemed to be patronised by the Eastern Delegates; but the Con- 
gress laid the papers on the table, and I hope will be wise enough to decline 
any interposition. I am for my own part clearly against assuming a 
judiciary power, such certainly never was the purpose of our Delegation. 
As I consider all jealousies as injurious to our common cause, and as 
laying the foundation of future evils, I use my best endeavours to discour- 
age them ; and I endeavour as much as possible to keep our attention to 
the main business, that of subduing our common enemy.^ 

The Confederation comes under consideration two days in every week. 
On this arduous subject you will easily imagine I want the assistance of 
my Colleagues, and indeed wish it reserved for men more able and exper- 
ienced than I am. I shall give it however the most attentive consideration, 
and certainly shall agree to nothing, but on the clearest conviction and 
most uncontroverted principles. I shall very carefully abstract all the 
debates of any moment upon it, and every other subject, but particularly 
upon that, and when I transmit it to you, I will transmit the debates also.^ 
At present, nothing but executive business is done, except the Confedera- 
tion, and on mere executive business there are seldom any debates; (and 
still more seldom any worth remembering). We have agreed to three 
articles : one containing the name : the second a declaration of the sov- 
reigntry of the States, and an express provision that they be considered as 
retaining every power not expressly delegated ; and the third an agreement 
mutually to assist each other against every enemy. The first and latter 
passed without opposition or dissent, the second occasioned two days 
debate. It stood originally the third article ; and expressed only a reserva- 
tion of the power of regulating the internal police, and consequently

r.tO Continental Congress 

resigned every otlier power. It appeared to me that this was not what the 
States expected, and, I thought, it left it in the power of the future Con- 
gfress or General Council to explain away every right belonging to the 
States and to make their own power as unlimited as they please. I pro- 
posed, therefore an amendment, which held up the principle, that all 
sovereign power was in the States separately, and that particular acts of 
it, which should be expressly enumerated, would be exercised in conjunc- 
tion, and not otherwise; but that in all things else each State would 
exercise all the rights and power of sovereignty, uncontrolled. This was 
at first so little understood that it was some time before it was seconded. 
and South Carolina first took it up. The opposition was made by Mr. 
Wilson of Pennsylvania, and Mr. R. H. Lee of Virginia : in the end how- 
ever the question was carried for my proposition, eleven ayes, one no, and 
one divided. The no was Virginia; the divided, New Hampshire. I was 
much pleased to find the opinion of accumulating powers to Congress so 
little supported, and I promise myself, in the whole business I shall find 
my ideas relative thereto nearly similar to those of most of the States. 
In a word. Sir, I am of opinion, the Congress should have power enough 
to call out and apply the common strength for the common defence : but 
not for the partial purposes of ambition. We shall next proceed to the 
structure of the common Councils ; and here, I think, we shall meet with 
diflEiculties of the most arduous nature.* The inequality of the States, and 
yet the necessity of maintaining their separate independence, will occasion 
dilemmas almost inextricable. You shall, Sir, know the whole progress 
of the matter if I can conceive and convey it with sufficient clearness.

As the Congress concieved your Dispatches to be of the utmost Im-

having fully considered the Matter, they do not wish that you should

Inclose your Excellency sundry Resolutions of Congress, which are to 
be executed, if approved of, by you and also the Quarter Master General 
and Commissary General's Orders to their Deputies for that purpose; to 
be expedited or detained as your Excellency shall judge best.^ 

The Reasons which induced the House to adopt the first Resolutions 
were founded on an apprehension that if the Enemy should penetrate the 
Country by Hudson's River, and your Excellency should be under the 
Necessity to march into Ulster, that you would be greatly distressed for 
provisions, that part of the Country affording little or none of the Meat 
Kind, altho' there is great plenty of Flour; not less than 20,000 Barrels 
as the president of the Convention informs me in a Letter of the i8th 
Instant: that it did not appear to the House that the Removal of the 
salted Meat from Derby and the three other places mentioned in the 
Resolve would put you to any Inconveniency. If you should be under the 
Necessity of marching into that part of New York on the East side of 
Hudson's River, Connecticut or the Massachusetts Bay a supply of the 
Meat Kind can be furnished from or in the two last mentioned States and 
Flour in or from the former. That the Wheat mentioned in the fourth 
Resolve should remain where it is to be thence sent into the more interior

Congress to have Genl Gates directed to fill your place. Doctr. Witherspoon rose and 
said he had no Objection, in Case he was restrained from appointing Mr Trumbull, on 
which one of your Friends rose, and said there was no need of a restriction of that kind,

469. Robert Morris to the Governor of Maryland 
(Thomas Johnson, jr.)-^ 

Philadelphia May ist. 1777 

Dear Sir 

I have seen with a good deal of Concern what appears to me an unfor- 
tunate dispute between your Excellency and Capt Nicholson in Conse- 
quence of his having followed the example of his Brother officers who 
have for sometime been Impressing men into the Naval Service of the 
Continent in this Port. 

The practice of Impressing Seamen cannot be supported on any other 
principle then Necessity and I am confident it is as pernicious to the 
Commercial Interests of a Country as destructive of the Civil Liberty of 
those Individuals who become its Victims, under these opinions you will 
readily see I cannot advocate the measure. Nothing but the prospect of 
great Public advantages to result from a well Manned Navy wou'd have 
induced me to be silent whilst these things were doing here, but it was 
properly the business of the Executive power of the State to notice and 
stop the Practice, they have not interfered and that probably because 
they saw and considered the force of Necessity, perhaps no great disad- 
vantages might have resulted to the State of Maryld. had you only 
Checked this business so far as it had come before you by Complaint from 
Individuals whose particular Situations or Circumstances might have 
called for exemption and protection, remember I don't offer these as 
fixed Sentiments or as proper considerations in a settled peaceable Govern- 
ment, because I know they are inconsistant with it but in times of Invasion 
and War especially such a War as ours, it seems to me that forcing out 
Militia against their will which I believe to have been much practiced is 
an equal infringement of Liberty with the Impressing of men for a limited 
time for the Naval service and it is to be observed that, it has hitherto 
been the practice at the end of every Cruize or Voyage made by our Con- 
tinental Ships the men have had their liberty again, in the Britsh Navy 
they are generally impressed for Life. Thus much in Paliation only 
With respect to Capt Nicholson he certainly deserves severe reprehension, 
the terms of his letter are quite unwarrantable and not a single Member 
of Congress offered to support him. you will see that the Resolves of 
Congress place him in your power so far as he values his Commission and 
at present he is at the head of the American Navy but I think the dispute 
unfortunate because I have been taught to believe him an excellent and 
Capable officer, the loss of such a one will be a real misfortune to the 
Continent and yet I think he ought to be dismissed unless by satisfactory 
submission he attones for the offensive Stile of his letter which I suppose 
to have been written in warmth inflamed by the Violence of that Species 
of Whiggism that savours more of passion than true Patriotism. I am 
told he is of a high Spirit and that it is doubtful if he will make the Con- 
cessions he ought. I wish not to be guilty of an improper interferance

and shall only rei)eat that if he is dismissed the service it will be a 
heavy loss, especially as the next in Command (Capt Manly) is vastly 
his inferiour in abilities, and knowing; as I do how much your Kxcellency 
wishes to promote the Service of America. I cou'd not refrain from men- 
tioning: my notions on this Subject.^ There is also another matter that 
gives me concern and that is the detention of Continental Troops on the 
Eastern Shoar to keep Tories in order at a time when Genl Washington 
cou'd strike a Capital stroke was he reinforced by those and others that 
ought to join him. I wish you wou'd think of this and order them to 
march on. other means may be found to keep the Tories in order there, 
you will merit and require the thanks of the continent if you think proper 
to improve this hint, the resolve of Congress for detaining them was 
obtained in consequence of your letter to me on that Subject.' ....

May 1st. [1777.] 
Sir 

You will see by the resolutions sent to you at this time that new Ideas 
are taking place here in regard to the western side of Tyconderoga.^ 

I apprehend you will be better informed than we are what expectations 
you can form with confidence about the number of eastern troops and the 
exact time when they will arrive to a certain necessary amount for your 
plans. An absolute order to relinquish the western Lines and fort was 
pushed for, but you find did not prevail. You certainly have not such a 
predilection for them as to run great risques of losing yr. Reputation in 
their defence with a few Troops, if only a few can be had. Nor are you of 
such a disposition as to leave them without much consideration, if they 
appear to be highly essential to our defence, and you receive according 
to yr. wishes troops and military stores 

But, another matter besides the foregoing will be upon yr. mind, on 
which you will expect to hear from me by this bearer. 

The affairs to the northeast are in a critical situation for the state of 
N : York in particular. Disaffection, as you see, is greatly prevalent; and 
those who profess well to our cause judge and say that there is but one 
single man who can keep their subjects united against the common enemy, 
and that he ^ stands on our books as commandr. in chief in the middle, or, 
as it is sometimes called, the northern departmt; that his presence is 
absolutely necessary in his home quarter for their immediate succour and 
service as well as that of the united states necessarily connected ; that if 
he returns, he is a Genl. without an army or Military Chest. And, " why 
is he thus disgraced " ? 

It is said that it is nonsence to give you the command of the northern 
army at Tyconderoga and confine you to that fort and mount Indepen- 
dence where you cannot have an extensive idea of the defence of the 
frontier of the eastern states, but only of one spot where the enemy are 
not obliged to confine their operations, and, as it were knock their heads

Sir: 

I wrote you day before yesterday by an express going to Charlestown, 
and after I had sealed up the letter, some intelligence was opened in Con- 
gress, which I wrote on a slip of paper and put into the cover. I doubt not 
you will receive it.'^ .... 

An insulting letter written by the Captain of one of the Continental 
Frigates to the Governor of Maryland has excited great indignation in 
Congress. The officer is suspended, and ordered in five days to make 
such satisfaction as the Governor and Council shall accept or, failing, to 
be dismissed the service.^ Every gentleman, (a few only excepted) 
seem to feel his own State injured in this insult, and they are determined

valuable Cargo, viz A Colonel, and 24 Officers of Artillery came Passengers in 

the above ship." Independent Chronicle, Apr. 24. 

In a postscript to a letter to John Adams, Apr. 23 {Warren- Adams Letters, I. 316), 
James Warren mentions the ship, cargo, and passengers in similar terms, and closes 
with this line : " 3 Mo. passage arrived last Sunday." See the Journals, May 8. The 
colonel was Du Coudray. Lists of the French officers who came with him are found 
in the Journals, Aug. 5, Sept. 2, Nov. 7. In the Amphitrite came also the notorious 
Thomas Conway. See Warren to Adams, Apr. 27, Warren-Adams Letters, I. 318; also

that nothing less should do, than what would satisfy Maryland, and con- 
vince officers that they were very inferior to the Magistrates of States, 
and must treat them with the most profound respect. I never had more 
hopes of Congress than I have now. All seem sensible that the honour 
and dignity of the Magistrates of the States ought to be preserved sacred 
and inviolable ; whether for applying the force of the State, or restraining 
abuses, and suppressing ambition. Your Excellency knows enough of my 
political creed to believe that this disposition is exceedingly pleasing to 
me. I have not time to add more, but that I have the honor to be,

Philadelphia, April [May,] 3, 1777 
My dear Sir, 

Yours of April 3d I recd.^ I must confess, that I am at a Loss to deter- 
mine whether it is good Policy in Us to wish for a War between France 
and Britain, unless We could be sure that no other Powers would engage 
in it : But if France engages Spain will, and then all Europe will arrange 
themselves on one side and the other and what Consequences to Us might 
be involved in it I don't know. If We could have a free Trade with 
Europe I should rather run the Risque of fighting it out with George and 
his present Allies, provided he should get no other. I don't love to be 
intangled in the Quarrels of Europe. I don't wish to be under Obligations 
to any of them, and I am very unwilling they should rob Us of the Glory 
of vindicating our own Liberties. 

It is a Cowardly Spirit in our Countrymen, which makes them pant 
with so much longing Expectation, after a French War. I have very 
often been ashamed to hear so many Whiggs groaning and Sighing with 
Despondency and whining out their Fears that We must be subdued 
unless France should step in. Are We to be beholden to France for our 
Liberties ? France has done so much already that the Honour and Dig- 
nity and Reputation of Great Britain is concerned to resent it, and if she 
does not, France will trifle with her forever hereafter. She has reed, our 
Ambassadors, protected our Merchant Men, Privateers, Men of War and 
Prizes, admitted Us freely to trade, lent Us Money, and supplied Us with 
Arms, Ammunition and Warlike Stores of every Kind. This is notorious 
all over Europe, and she will do more, presently, if our dastardly Despon- 
dency, in the midst of the finest Prospects imaginable, does not discourage 
her. The surest and the only Way to secure her Arms in this Cause is 
for Us to exert our own. For God's sake then don't fail of a single Man 
of your Quota. Get them at any Rate, and by any Means rather than not 
have them. 

I am more concerned about our Revenue than the Aid of France. Pray 
let the Loan Offices do their Part, that We may not be compelled to make 
Paper Money as plenty and of Course as cheap as Oak Leaves. There is 
so much Injustice in carrying on a War with a depreciating Currency 
that We can hardly pray w'ith Confidence for success.

Philadelphia May 6 1777 
Dear Sir, 

I had a few days ago the Pleasure of receiving your Favour of the 
16 ult. 

The Subject of Finances is the most important of any that can come 
under our Consideration, if we can Support these we can carry on the 
war with Vigour and probably with success. But if we go on as we have 
we must suffer extream Distress. The Science of a Financier is to be 
learned only from Books or from Travel. I have scarce a Moment to 
look into a Book and I never travelled. Some of our Bostonian Genius's 
who understand the Nature of Commerce and of Money must turn their 
Thoughts to these Subjects. 

I think with you that we ought to negotiate with some foreign Power 
Loans of Cash. But this is attended with great Difficulty. We might 
possibly borrow, but there is a vast Risque in transporting the Money 
across the sea.^ 

I know not what to say of the Lottery, you say is in Contemplation. I 
dread the Effects of the Gambling Spirit that is abroad. Salt, Lead, 
Sulphur, Allum and Copperas, are Articles of great Importance, but 
whether you cannot import them cheaper than you can make them, 
(under all the Risques) I know not

Philadelphia, May 6, 1777 
Dear Sir, 

About Ten Days ago I had the Boldness to make a Motion that a Navy 
Board should be established at Boston. Certain Gentlemen looked struck 
and surprised ; however, it passed. I have moved I believe fifteen Times, 
that a Nomination should take Place ; certain Gentlemen looked cold. 

Two or three Days ago, the Nomination came on. Langdon, Vernon, 
Deshon, Dalton, Orne, Henley, Smith, Gushing and Warren, were 
nominated. ^ 

This Day the Choice came on. At last Vernon, Warren, and Deshon 
were chosen. The Board are to appoint their own Clerk who is to have 
500 Dollars a year. I hope you will engage in this Business and conduct 
it with Spirit. You cannot be speaker and do this Duty too I believe. 

I think the Tow^n of Boston will be offended. But I could not help it. 
This you will not mention. The Salary for the Commissioners is 1500 
Dollars a Year. You will have the Building and fitting of all Ships, the 
appointment of Officers, the Establishment of Arsenals and Magazines, 
etc., which will take up your whole Time. But it will be honourable to be 
so capitally concerned in laying a Foundation of a great Navy, The profit

tic advice of my being chosen, or another delegate shall have arrived. 
Therefore, let me intreat that it may be done, that the new delegates may 
come forward immediately. The circumstances of my family require 
that I should return as soon as possible, to make some suitable provisions 
for it, and my long, constant attention in Congress demands relaxation.^

No direct Charge had been urged against him ; a series of sly Insinua-

Feelings of some unwortliy Treatment, severe Reliukes, and Animadver- 
sions on his Expressions, and his supposed want of Ivespect to his Super- 
iors. Those were Weapons employed so successfully, as in the End pro- 
duced some resolutions of Congress, paring away his Authority to Noth- 
ing. It took us some time to become acquainted with the new ^Tembers, 
and to undeceive those who wished for Conviction. We had in the mean- 
time got a Committee appointed to inquire into the General's Conduct at 
large.^ That Business went on heavily and seemed to promise no Con- 
clusion. We therefore were under the Necessity to take a more direct 
Course. The General's Account of the Specie was at his request reex- 
amined (after it had been passed by the Commissioners) at the Treasury 
Board who made a full report in his Favor, which was received by Con- 
gress and ordered to be published.' This Report, a printed Copy of which 
is herewith transmitted, had a powerful Effect on many of the Members, 
who heard it with the utmost Pleasure, and frankly acknowledged that 
they had been deceived. 

The way being thus prepared, the General presented a Memorial to 
Congress, stating such of their Resolutions, as conveyed a Censure upon 
him, justifying himself in every particular. This after some Debate pro- 
duced a unanimous Resolution of Congress, That the Memorial was Satis- 
factory, and that the Congress entertained the same favorable Opinion 
of the General as they entertained before the passing those Resolutions.* 

A compleat and honorable Vindication of the General's Character and 
Conduct being implied in that resolution, and the infamous Charge of 
embezzling the Specie effectually done away by the Report from the 
Treasury, we shall give ourselves no trouble about the proposed Enquiry ; 
especially as Congress came into the Appointment of the Committee with 
the utmost reluctance, almost every Member declaring that there was no 
Accuser or Charge against the General, and that the Enquiry was there- 
fore unnecessary. All Impediments being now removed, we shall proceed 
to take the most speedy Measures for reinstating the General in his Com- 
mand.* In the critical Situation of our Affairs, his Services are loudly 
called for: We therefore conceived that this Business ought first to be 
dispatched. It unavoidably occasions some delay in the other Matters 
committed to our Charge, but You may be assured that they shall be 
attended to, with all the zeal and diligence of which we are capable.

Franklin's misconduct. As to our Government being informed of it, he 
says that he told Genii Parsons of it, and that Mr Burr of Fairfield was 
also informed of it. Mr. Duer is zealously engaged to suppress Tories.*

Dec. 3, 1776, July 28, Oct. 22, 1777. A letter of Titus Hosmer to William Williams, 
June 27, 1777, throws light upon some phases of the matter : 

" Tho' I believe you remember the Affair, yet least it may have slipped from you the 
Case stands thus â€” last Winter Colo. Duer informed Genl Parsons that Govr. Franklin 
was dispersing the Howes proclamations and protections in this state, that a Number 
of the Members of the General Assembly received Protections of him at Middletown, 
and that he would furnish him with Evidence tc prove the Charge against the particular 
Members that were guilty. 

" This Story Genl. Parsons published, chance fixed the Censure upon Three Gentle- 
men vyc. you know. Genl Parsons was called upon for Evidence to support the facts 
and direct a prosecution against those so namd. He promised to procure it, and alledges 
that he wrote several Letters to Colo. Duer requesting him to furnish requisite proofs 
to which he had no answer, in the Meantime Colo. Duer reports at Congress 
that Govr. Franklin was circulating Protections in Connecticut, that this was publicly 
known here, and no Notice was taken of it 

" I for my self yet earnestly wish to know the Truth, and bring to Condign punish- 
ment any Persons especially any Members of Assembly concerned in so villainous a 
Transaction, and shall esteem it a very particular favour in you to wait upon Colo. 
Duer and request him to give Directions how we may come at proof or any Clue to 
unravel this Transaction and bring it to light and expose and punish those Concerned." 
(Conn. Hist. Soc, William Williams Papers.) It is evident from Hosmer's statements 
that " the gentleman who gave information ", etc., was Mr. Duer.

P. S. I should think it advisable to represent to General Washington 
the necessity of having the battalions stationed in Connecticut. When 
the Board of War had the matter under consideration the resolution of 
Congress was not before them, but they supposed it was at General Wash-

following extract of a letter from Joseph Trumbull, then in Philadelphia, to Jeremiah 
Wadsworth throws light on some of the proceedings of Congress upon the Schuyler 
affair as well as upon the proceedings concerning the commissary department. The 
letter, dated May 17 (the latter part of the postscript was written May 19), is in the 
Maine Historical Society, Revolution, no. 7 : 

"(P. S.) Are not some of our Delegates coming on here? Mr. Sherman is left alone, 
and he wishes a little rest. 

" As to Bror. Jack â€” on Mr Lovell's rect. of his last letter to him which you saw, it 
was moved in Congress ; that Genl Gates should have power to fill his place. On which 
Dr Witherspoon rose and said he had no Objection, so that he was restrained from 
appointing Mr Trumbull. On this he was Replied to and told that, the Young Gentleman 
dispized the Idea of asking a Commission of the first date, as a Favr. and it could not be 
supposed that he would be mean eno' to take one of a whole Year's later date. But 
to remove that Gentleman's fears, he would move in behalf of the Young Gentleman, that 
his Resignation might be Accepted and if he pleased that he might never be able to 
hold another Commission as he was sure he never would accept one, after the Treatment 
he had reed, however his Resignation was Accepted. So that he is quite out of the 
Army, and I hope will never be in it again. I have since applied to Colo Hancock 
several Times in person and by Writing to know when the Commission was sentâ€” 
he has not, and will not do it. I intend to apply once more, if he don't give it, I will 
ask Congress for it. I am Convinced [he neve]r Sent it, and I fancy he never intended 
to. [Hancock?] is going on to Boston. I have noticed this matter to Govr. Trumbull, 
that he may treat him accordingly as he passes. Every Act is Using here to get Genl 
Gates recalled, the Event, I can't yet give yon. perhaps I may before I close this. Genl

I think it ought to be. they have not got to that part yet. I gave them the Terms, â€”

mined to have my own Terms or have nothing. I am to appoint one Deputy Com- 
missary Genl of Purchases in Each Department, and he to have such others under 
him, of my appointment, as may be best, but to reduce the Numbers. I never will 
ask any appointment of them. A large Party will be glad to be rid of me. I shall not 
be disappointed if they don't give the offer. Or if they do, if they should set the allow-

tion of the distresses to which the unhappy Petitioners were reduced, from 
a State of Ease and affluence ; and the Gentlemen who presented the Peti- 
tion have urged every motive which could either show the Justice and 
Policy of granting the Request, or which could move the humanity and 
Charity of those who heard it. 

These Endeavors of theirs have been seconded by your Delegates in 
Congress, but to no other Effect than to obtain a Committee to consider 
the Petition, whose Report altho' it expresses much Sympathy with that 
virtuous People in Affliction, contains a Denyal of their Request on ac- 
count of the present condition of the Finances of the United States : as, the 
granting of Compensation even in Part, at this Time, would set a Pre- 
cedent for so many and so great Demands, of a similar Nature that the 
public treasury would not be able to Spare so much from the necessary 
Calls of the War. 

There was a Great deal of Delicacy shown thro the whole debate upon 
this Subject, every one wished it was in the power of Congress to grant 
the desired Relief; most acknowledged the Justice of the Demand; but, 
all agreed that, at present it would be impolitic to grant it â€” except the 
delegates from the Massachusetts Bay. 

Upon a Motion that a Small Part of the Losses should be made up, 
such was the reluctance to giving a negative that the previous Question 
was moved and put; so that a present determination might not prejudice 
the Petitioners in any Future application. 

It may be doubtfull whether such petetions to Congress, from particular 
Corporations, or Independants in any State are proper. Perhaps it would 
be better that each State shd. ascertain the amount of its own Lx)sses, in 
this Kind, and represent it to Congress ; that so, in the End, some Adjust- 
ment may be made between the several States. 

That such an adjustment will, sooner or later, be made is not doubted 
by Us : because, neither Equity nor sound policy will admit that different 
states, contending in the same common Cause, having in View the same 
common Benefit, should be unequally loaded with expense, or suffer dis- 
proportionate Losses, but, as it is impossible to foresee what Course the 
War will take, or what State will be the greatest Sufferer, it is probable 
this question will be postponed untill the End of the War. 

In the mean Time, our Brethren and Neighbors, virtuously struggling 
together with us for every Thing that is valuable, and reduced from Pros- 
perity to Adversity by the cruel Stroke of War, must not be left to suffer 
unnoticed. This would be plainly repugnant to the dictates of Humanity, 
to the Precepts of Christian Charity to the Rules of common Justice and 
the soundest policy; â€” a Chain of Motives which doubtless produced the 
Grants already made by the General Assembly of our State for the imme- 
diate Subsistence of these sufferers. But, as the unfortunate Petitioners 
were deprived of their necessary Tools and Materials for Business, it was 
remarked by the Gentleman who pleaded for them in Congress, that an 
advance sufficient to replace those Things would be a most essential Relief 
and by far the most economical in the end. And it was suggested that 



3 

such Estates of disaffected Persons as may be sequestered or confiscated, 
tliroughout the Limits of our Union, mipht be a Fund, to insure the Loan 
of Monies, for compensating;- patriotic Sufferers. This, however, was not 
formally recommended. Lach State is competent to the Business, if 
judged proper. 

Having: reported this Affair as it has been conducted in Congress," we 
wish it to be communicated by you to the Honorable House, for any 
Emolument which their Wisdom may direct.

Philadelphia 22d. May 1777 

Dear General 

The subject of your letter of the 27th. [i7th]^ is a very important one. 
and whilst it deserves the greatest attention, is certainly involved in great 
difflculty. Of one truth however, I beg you Sir to be convinced â€” That no 
desire to get rid of importunity has occasioned these appointments, but 
motives military and political meerly. 

These Adventurers may be divided into three Classes, some who came 
early and without any recommendation but apparent zeal, with Commis- 
sions shewing that they had been in service. Others that brought with 
them recommendations from our good friend the Count D'Argoud Gen- 
eral of Martinique, and from Mr. Bingham the Continental agent in that 
Island. A third Class includes those who come from France, generally

ibid., V. 367. Washington's reply to Lee, June i, is ibid., V. 403. Numerous other 
letters of Washington dealt with this question. The difficulties of Congress from the 
application of foreigners for military appointments had become acute some time before, 
and they were to become still more so. See, for instance, the Journals, Mar. 13, 14, 
19, 21. May 8, 30, June 10, July 16, 17, Aug. 13, Sept. 8, Oct. 10, Nov. 7, 11, 14; also

under agreement with our Commissioners, or one of them at least. ^ The 
strongest obligations rest upon us, (tho' the inconvenience is great) to 
make good engagements with the latter, and if the second had been disre- 
garded we might have oflfended a good and powerful Friend in Martinique 
who has done many good offices there; or have brought our Agent into 
disrepute. Among the first Class, I realy believe there are many worthless 
Men, and I heartily wish we were rid of them. All this is true, and yet I 
feel the great force of your reasoning, and the many difficulties in the 
way of providing for them properly and that may be tolerably [agjreeable 
to them. It is of some consequence that we all, [in] our several depart- 
ments, endeavor to smooth this rug[ge]d business as much as possible. 
When Gen. Con [way] was appointed, I did hope that as he knew most 
[of] them, and spoke both french and English well, tha[t] [h]e might 
relieve you from the greater part of this difficulty,* for realy the discon- 
tented importunit[y] of the greater part of those Gentlem. is too much to 
be borne un[der] [o]ur various and important attention [**] I will pre- 
vail with the Committee for foreign applications to furnish you with the 
most explicit views of Congress in ev[ery] appointment, as well as with 
the recommendations under which each appointment was and is made. 
We have written both to France and to Martinique to stop the furthe[r] 
flow of these Gentlemen here, and after the letters arrive I suppose we 
shall have no more. Many of the last Comers, are, I believe, Men of 
real merit, and if they will learn to express themselves tolerably in English, 
may be of service to the xA-rmy. The desire to obtain Engineers, and 
Artillerists was the principal cause of our being so overburthened. The 
first that came had sagacity enough quickly to discern our wants, and 
professing competency in these branches, â€” they were too quickly believed. 
And when our Commissioners abroad (in consequence of directions for 
this purpose) enquired for those x\rtists. Military Speculation was imme- 
diately up, and recommendations were obtained from persons of so much 
consideration in France, that the success of our applications then made 
it quite necessary not to neglect them. And at this moment I am appre- 
hensive that the discontent of many may injure our cause abroad when we 
would wish it to stand well. As you express it Sir, the affair requires 
great delicacy in its management, as well on the account of our own 
Officers as on that of these Foreigners.

PiiiLADA. May 22(1. 1777 
Dear Sir 

The strange delays of Mr. Yancey ^ here, greatly mortifying to him, 
have drawn me on day by day from an earlier acknowledgment of your 
favor of Apr. 29th. 

Indeed, I could not have related to you, before this time, any interesting 
decisions concerning such matters as have been moved in Congress con- 
nected with Tyconderoga.^ 

Misconstructions of past resolves, and consequent jealousies, have pro- 
duced a definition of the northern department; and General Schyler is 
ordered to take the command of it. The resolve also which was thought 
to fix Head Quarters at Albany is repealed.* 

It was said you tioiv look upon yourself in the same command which 
he had held. This was universally denyed to be the Intention of sending 
you to Tyconderoga to take the command of the army there. The Debate 
in March was about the Adjutancy or Tyconderoga ; and it was decided 
for the latter.^ In the present Debate I acknowledged it was my hope and 
7vish, at the time you went, and still continues to be, that the officer who 
is at so very important a post shd. not be under the absolute orders of 
another at 100 miles distance, in treaty with Indians or busied in the duties 
of a Providore. This Idea was supported by several : and it is, of itself, 
an irrefragible argument of the impropriety of distributing America into 
departments. A commander in-chief and Commanders of the separate 
armies is the only distinction which should be known. However, this was 
contrary to our Journals. Besides, the army at Ty â€” and the force at 
Stanwix etc. etc., at a distance were looked upon as different subjects; tho 
it appears you have other ideas than those had who directed your desti- 
nation. No single debate has been more tedious with us ; â€” having lasted

proper weight in the piibHc Councils. So unequaled as the States are, it 
will be nearly impossible to effect this; and after all it is far from improb- 
able that the only Confederation will be a defensive Alliance." Nothing 
of importance has been determined in Congress, except what is merely 
executory 

P. S. In one of my letters I believe I mentioned that Georgia was of 
no use in Congress but to vote with Connecticut.^ This was owing I 
believe to this circumstance, only one Delegate was then present, who is 
by birth a Connecticut man. Since then a Mr. Walton has given his 
attendance, which was before interrupted by illness; and I perceive that 
Georgia is now frequently divided when any question relates to Colonial 
politics, so that these two Delagates are of different principles or different

Congress took up Capt Nicholsons affair^ and were unanimously of 
Opinion he had not made the Satisfaction he ouj:,dit to have made and on 
Examination of the order from the Marine Committee with Respect to 
the impressed men they found that Committee had acted very unwarrant- 
ably in explaining the Resolve of Congress on that Subject in such a 
narrow limited sense Congress meant every man to be discharged without 
any Discrimination of such as subscribed the article [s] and took the 
Bounty and the Resolve was full and explicit to that Purpose The Marine 
Committee were severely handled for presuming to explain at all the 
Resolve but the more reprehensible for giving a Sense to it which might 
have defeated the whole Design of it. Mr. Carroll and I were directed 
to prepare a fresh Set of Resolutions We did so one of which declared 
Capt. Nicholson dismissed from the Command of the Virginia frigate for 
not making that full Satisfaction to the Governor and Council of May'' 
which by a former Resolve of Congress he was ordered to do : a second 
Resolve restored him to his Command on his explicit Disapprobation of 
his Letter: and a third Resolve ordered the commanding officer of the 
Frigate to deliver up every impressed man who should now be considered 
such by any Persons the Governor and Council should send on Board for 
the Purpose of making the Enquiry ; these Resolutions would have passed 
unanimously but Mr. Lewis coming up and assuring us of his having Con- 
versation w'ith our Council who declared they would be satisfied with the 
Concessions which were contained in Nicholsons first Letter and which 
were satisfactory to the Governor and Mr. Lewis further assuring us that 
Capt. Nicholson had wrote a second Letter in Consequence thereof and dis- 
charged every man who did not chuse to remain We have been induced 
from these assurances to postpone doing any thing in the matter till we 
hear further from you on that Subject. Mr. Lewis further says that Capt. 
Nicholson is about joining the Virginia armed Vessels wath an Intent to 
attack the Man of War in the Bay. I can with pleasure inform you the 
Congress shewed a determined Spirit to give full Satisfaction on both 
points and I am confident they would have dismissed Capt. Nicholson 
without Hesitation if we had not proposed to restore him on his explicit 
Disapprobation of his Letters which was the Satisfaction you in your's 
to him demanded : 3'ou may be further assured Capt. Nicholson had not 
even an Intimation from Congress or Committee to impress : I am sur- 
prised that Mr. Rumsey who was on the Marine Committee approved of 
the Explanation they gave the Resolve to discharge the impressed men :

506. Richard Henry Lee to the Governor of Virginia.^ 

Philadelphia, May 26, 1777. 
My dear Sir,^ 

.... But the truth is sir, that certain evil disposed men hate me, partly 
for the same reason that I am devoted to destruction in the enemies' camp, 
because I have served my country with unremitting zeal and industry, and 
in concert with other generous friends to human liberty and the rights of 
America, have gone far towards defeating our enemies, and raising Amer- 
ica triumphant over its cruel vindictive, and determined foes. But it seems 
there are two other charges equally futile and false ; the one that I have 
favored New^ England to the injury of Virginia. The other that as a 
Member of the Secret Committee I objected to their proceedings being 
laid before Congress, meaning to insinuate that I wished to conceal em- 
bezzlement of the public money ! The wretch who carried, or sent this 
last account to Virginia, knows perfectly w^ell, that my total abstraction 
from every commercial concern, renders it impossible that I can propose 
any kind of good to myself from trading business of any sort. But I have 
a strong belief that a change is w^ished, in order to remove obstruction 
feared from me, and to prepare the way for the execution of private plans, 
in which the public will not be gainer. The affair alluded to, is, I suppose, 
a very inconsiderate motion made at Baltimore for the secret committee to 
lay all its proceedings before Congress. I observed, that so extensive a 
motion defeated the very end for which such a committee was appointed, 
and might expose to danger valuable cargoes that should be coming in, or 
might be going out, particularly the former. The motion was narrowed, 
and even as it was agreed to ^ Mr. Morris, the chairman of the committee, 
who was here at the time, did by letter so convince the Congress of the 
impropriety of the order as it passed, that nothing more was said about it.* 
We did indeed expect at that very time the arrival of the valuable stores 
that have since come in. The charge of favoring New England is so con- 
temptibly wicked, that I can scarcely bring myself to the trouble of 
refuting it, or to trespass on your time to read my observations on it.

Our enemies, and our friends too, know that America can only be con- 
quered by disunion. The former, by unremitting art liad endeavored to 
create jealousy and discord between the Southern and Eastern Colonies, 
and in truth Sir, they had so far prevailed, that it required constant atten- 
tion, and a finnness not to be shaken, to prevent the malicious act [art?] 
of our enemies from succeeding. I am persuaded as I am of my existence, 
that had it not been for Virginia and Jersey, with Georgia sometimes, 
that our union would e'er now have been by this means broken, like a 
potter's vessel dashed against a rock; and I heartily wish that this greatest 
of all political evils may not yet take place, before a safe and honourable 
peace is established. I am sure it will not be the fault of many men that 
I know, if this event does not happen. I defy the poisonous tongue of 
slander to produce a single instance, in which I have preferred the interest 
of New England to that of Virginia. Indeed I am at a loss to know 
wherein their interests clash. The guilt of New England is that of a fixed 
determination against British Tyranny, and such I believe is the crime of 
Virginia in the eye of their common enemies. Most of the rest have 
entitled themselves to some hopes of pardon from the tyrant, by weak, 
dividing, irresolute, and pernicious conduct. One thing is certain, that 
among the Middle and Southern states Virginia has many enemies ; aris- 
ing from jealousy and envy of her wisdom, vigor, and extent of Territory. 
But I have ever discovered upon every question, respect and love for 

Virginia among the Eastern delegates 

The enclosed resolve of Congress is intended to prevent injury to the 
recruiting business and other public service, in the absence of a General 
officer from Virginia.* I beg your pardon Sir, for the trouble I have given 
you, and wish to be considered as affectionately yours,

Nothing gives me more constant Anxiety than the Delays in publishing

We have had a Committee constantly attending to this very Thing, for 
a long Time.' But We have too many Irons in the Fire, you know for 
Twenty Hands, which is nearly the whole Number We have had upon an 
average since last fall. The Committee are now busy every day in cor- 
recting Proof sheets, So that I hope We shall soon do better. 

A Committee on the Post office too have found a thousand difficulties.* 
The Post is now very regular, from the North and South, altho it comes 
but once a Week. It is not easy to get f aithfull Riders to go of tener. The 
expense is very high, and the Profits, (so dear is every thing, and so little 
Correspondence is carried on, except in frankd Letters), will not Support 
the office. Mr. Hazard is now gone Southward, in the Character of sur- 
veyor of the Postoffice, and I hope will have as good success, as he lately 
had eastward, where he has put the office into good order 

No poor Mortals were ever more perplexed than We have been, with 
three Misfortunes at once, any one of which would have been alone suffi- 
cient to have distressed Us. a Redundancy of the Medium of Exchange, 
a dimunition of the Quantity at markett of the Luxuries, the Conveniences

he recommended by the Bragadiers and appointed by Congress, with the 
pay rations and Forrage allowed to Colonels.^ This new and honorable 
Establishment is designed to suppress the horrid sins of Cursing swearing 
and other Vices with which. I am sorry to say, our Army Vies with the 
most abandoned of the English Troops; to strengthen the Officers hands 
by publick and private exortations to obedience of General and Regimental 
Orders; to discourage Disertions by recommending the Service ; to encour- 
age Enlistments ; to recommend cleenlyness as a virtue conducive to 
health, and to reprehend the neglect of it. These and other valuable Ends 
with the Countenance and concurrence of General Officers by the blessing 
of heaven I doubt not may be answered by a careful choice and recom- 
mendation of pious Clergymen zealously attached to our glorious Cause, 
who will not begrudge the exertion of every nerve in the Service ; but 
if Drones induced by the loaves and Fishes should creep into the Army the

â€” Genl. Gates had the address whilst at the place to insinuate himself into 
the good graces of even the honest part of the House, and the wretched- 
ness to poison the minds of most with prejudices against Genl. Schuyler, 
which operated so strongly that nothing but time, and great temper and 
address could have dispelled the mist of error which had clouded the eyes 
even of those who were friends to the great cause, and to the State of 
New York. His own merit however which they have had an opportunity 
of seeing, and the all powerful influence of truth assisted with manage- 
ment at length effected all our wishes, and we carried the question upon 
his being reinstated in his command in the Northern Department in the

Genl. Schyler sent to take the command. By a repeal of an old resolve, 
he will not appear to be obliged to make his Head Quarters at Albany, 
100 miles from the army; nor is he obliged to go from that city except by 
true military feelings. Can you readily determine in your own mind 
where he will reside, from the data now before you? Genl. Gates will 
most assuredly not take the post of hazard both to his life and reputation, 
to be under the absolute direction of a man 35 leagues oflf, in treaties with 
Indians, or acting as a Providore to his army at the same distance. I

In our last ^ we informd you of the Success of our Efforts in vindication 
of General Schuyler, and it gives us great Satisfaction to observe from 
your Vote of Thanks to Congress, and other Circumstances, that the hon- 
ourable Lssue of this perplexed and delicate Business has met with general 
Approbation. Major General Gates a few days since arrivd in this City 
greatly chagreend, and enragd against your Delegates to whom he as- 
cribes what without any solid Reason, he is pleased to call his disgrace. 
As in this Enquiry Justice has been our View, and Truth our guide, we 
feel ourselves very indifferent about his Resentment.' 

We have since assiduously labourd two Points of great Moment to the 
State which we havT the honour to represent. The first â€” a Recommenda- 
tion of Congress to the united States respectively to encourage and facili-

Congress until July 22 of this year, and was not placed upon the secret committee until 
Aug. 12, it is evident that his name is improperly signed to the letter. It appears however 
that this copy of the letter was made from a copy enclosed in a letter from the committee 
to Pollock, Oct. 24 (ibid., f. ^7), to which all three names are attached. Laurens no

tate our being supplied with Salt and other European and West India 
Commodities. We have not only succeeded in this Object but, with a 
Testimonial highly to the Honour of New York, obtaind the additional 
Favour of a grant of near 2000 bushels of the publick Salt in Store at 
Plymouth in the Massachusett's bay, which for our more immediate 
Relief the Commissary General is directed to exchange for an equal Quan- 
tity nearer to our State if it can be done wMthout Injury to the Service. 
When you reflect on some late Regulations of our Eastern Neighbours, 
you will readily perceive the Policy of the first of these Resolutions which 
evidently implies a Reprobation of the ungenerous Restraints which they 
have imposed upon a Sister and confederated State, whose misfortunes 
and Distresses demanded a very different Treatment; since they were 
drawn upon her only on Account of her attachment to the common Cause.* 

The other Point wdiich we had at Heart, and which has employd much 
of our Attention, was a Regulation of the Commissary General's Depart- 
ment ; The Abuses w^hich had crept into it from the Want of Method and 
proper Checks, the Folly of Purchasing and the Negligence of the issuing 
Commissaries : to say nothing of Fraud and Embezilment ; called aloud 
for Reformation; and the Depreciation of our Bills of Credit to which 
more than any other Cause it contributed made it a Subject still more 
serious and important. A System is formed which if properly carried into 
effect, will be productive of that Oeconomy which in all our Affairs seems 
hitherto to have been but little practic'd. It is now in the Press and shou'd 
it be publish'd before these dispatches are closd, we shall not fail to 
transmit it.^ ....

reprobates in effect the commercial Regulations kindly passed by our

great things he had effected at Albany ; even the Suppression of Toryism

a personal familiarity w^hich was altogether unparliamentary. He was 
not very unguarded in his Expressions (for what he deliverd was from 
a written paper) but he showd very plainly that he singled me out as the 
Author of his Disgrace â€” for so he termed it. For this personal Address 
I called him to order : many members interposd, even to a Clamour, and 
insisted that he shoud withdraw^ and he with marks of Reluctance was 
obligd to submit. After he retird he was censurd by several members

very freely for his Personality and it was directed that he shond be in- 
formd that it was the pleasure of Congress that if he had anything to 
offer they expected to hear it by way of memorial only. I have no doubt 
but the general has heard very minutely what part I took with respect to 
him. I do not repent it. The Interest of the Continent, the Honour of 
Congress, and the dictates of Justice requird it ; and I must put up with 
the General's displeasure; which I find myself disposd to do with great 
Resignation and Philosophy. I have since been in his Company â€” we 
were civil; but rather reservd. He has heard from several candid Mem- 
bers that only one or two Justified his Claim to the Command and that 
the rest declard that there was no room for his supposing it ever had been 
invested in him. He ought to feel more pain and Resentment from this 
Circumstance than from anything which fell from me. I am apt to think 
he does, for he has made no Representation to Congress, and instead of 
resigning talks of going to Genl. Washington's Camp. If I might guess 
he expects that you will be elected Governour of New York, and resign 
your military Honours, and that then he will be reinstated in the posses- 
sion of what he has much at Heart, the Command of the Northern Depart- 
ment. I do not feel at all pleasd with the latter part of this Reflection ; but 
I hate to anticipate disagreeable Events. There are several Ifs in the 
Way â€” as // it shoud be attempted. If it can't be prevented etc. // I cant 
be reconcild to it etc. etc. which renders it unnecessary to be at present 
much Concernd 

The Plan for regulating the Commissary's Department is compleated.' 
If out of the press I shall order it with these dispatches. You know in 
what situation you left this affair. Trumbull is appointed Commissary 
General of Purchases four Deputy Commissary Generals of purchases are 
elected. We had a delicate Card to play and which requird much Ad- 
dress, to get this office into the hands of a fellow Citizen for the Northern 
Department, our Eastern Neighbours were in possession and worked 
hard to maintain their Ground. But it was of moment to our State who 
was to govern their markets and by the disposal of immense Sums to in- 
fluence their Policy; and it greatly concernd the Continent that prices 
shoud be Judiciously regulated and the Army well supplied. I therefore 
labourd assiduously and we were crownd with Success : our Friend Jacob 
Cuyler Esqr. obtaind the office, and I am persuaded will execute it with 
Integrity and Ability and do Honour to my Recommendation and that of 
my Colleagues.* 

I enclose you another Set of Resolutions with respect to our State which 
will give you pleasure as it proves the favourable Light we stand in here, 
you on recollecting the Commercial Regulations lately passed by our 
Eastern Neighbours, so ungenerous and distressing to New York cannot 
but be pleasd with the Reprobation of their conduct evidently implied in 
the first of these Resolutions ; and you may wonder at our good fortune in

My dear General, 

I embrace the earliest Opportunity of returning my Part of acknowl- 
edgement for your Letter of the 9th June to myself and Colleagues. I had 
no doubt when you left this Place - but you would find AfTairs in your 
Quarter in a distracted Situation ; but I doubt not from your Perseverance

Yesterday* Major Genl. Gates arrived in Town, and about 12 oClock 
at Noon Mr. Sherman inform'd Congress that he was waiting at the Door, 
and w^ished Admittance. Mr. Paca desir'd to know for what Purpose â€” 
to which friend Roger replied to communicate Intelligence of importance. 
He was accordingly usher'd in, and after some awkward ceremony, sat 
himself in a very Easy Cavalier Posture in an Elbow Chair, and began to 
open his Budget. 

The intelligence he communicated was that the Indians were Extremely 
friendly, much delighted with seeing French officers in our Service, and 
other common place stufif which at present I cannot recollect. Having 
thus gone through the Ostensible Part of the Plan, he took out of his 
Pocket some scraps of Papers, containing a Narrative of his Birth Par- 
entage mid Education Life Character, and Behavior. He inform'd the 
House that he had quitted an easy and happy Life to enter into their 
Service from a pure Zeal for the Liberties of America, that he had stren- 
uouslv exerted himself in its Defence ; that in some Time in Mav last he

was appointed to a Command in the Northern Department, and that a few 
days since without having given any Cause of Offence, without Accusa- 
tion, without Trial, without hearing, without Notice, he had received a 
Resolution by which he was in a most disgraceful Manner superseded in 
his Command. Here his Oration became warm and contain'd many 
Reflections upon Congress, and malicious Insinuations against Mr. Duane, 
whose Name he mentioned, and related some Conversation which he said 
had pass'd betwixt him, and that Gentleman on his Way to Albany. Here 
Mr. Duane rose, and addressing himself to the President, hoped that the 
General would observe order and cease any Personal applications, as he 
could not in congress enter into any Controversy with him on the subject 
of any former Conversation. Mr. Paca caught the Fire, and immediately 
moved that the General might be ordered to withdraw ; I seconded the 
motion, observing that the Conduct of the General was unbecoming the 
Plouse to endure, and himself to be guilty of. Mr. Jerry Dysen,^ Mr. 
Sherman, and some others of his Eastern Friends rose, and endeavour'd 
to palliate his Conduct, and to oppose his Withdrawing; on this Mr. 
Middleton Mr. Burke, Colo. Harrison and two or three others arose, and 
there was a General Clamour in the House that he should immediately 
Withdraw â€” all this While General stood upon the Floor, and interposed 
several Times in the Debates which arose on this Subject, however the 
Clamour encreasing he withdrew. A Debate then ensued concerning the 
Propriety of the General's Conduct, and that of the Members who con- 
trary to the Rules of Parliament, contended for the Propriety of his stay- 
ing, after a Motion had been made and seconded that he should withdraw. 

The Want of Candor in Mr. Sherman who asked for his Admittance on 
the Pretence of his giving the House Intelligence was much inveigh'd 
against, but he bore it all with a true Connecticut stoicism. Congress at 
length came to the Determination that Genl. Gates should not again be 
admitted on the Floor, but that he should be inform'd that Congress were 
ready, and willing to hear by Way of Memorial any Grievances which he 
had to complain of. here this Matter ended â€” not, as you will observe to 
his Credit, or Advantage. 

It is impossible for me to give you an Idea of the unhappy Figure wli. 
G. G. made on this Occasion. His manner was ungracious, and Totally 
void of all Dignity, his Delivery incoherent and interrupted with frequent 
Chasms, in which he was pering over his scattered Notes, and the Tenor 
of his Discourse a Compound of Vanity, Folly, and Rudeness. I can 
assure you that notwithstanding his Conduct has been such as to have 
eradicated from my Mind every sentiment of Respect, and Esteem for him, 
I felt for him as a man, and for the Honor of hum.an Nature wishd him to 
withdraw before he had plunged himself into utter Contempt. You will 
perhaps think it was improper in me to second the IMotion that he should

Intention to brow beat the New York Members, whom he considers as his 
Mortal Enemies, and I was determin'd to let him see that it was indifferent 
to me whether I offended him, or not. 

Perhaps he may take it into his head to call me out, as he quitted the 
House with the utmost Indignation, should this be the Case I am 
determin'd not to she[l]ter myself under Priviledge, being convinced of 
the Necessity there is to act with Spirit, to enable me to discharge with 
Fidelity the Trust reposed in me 

I have the Pleasure to inform you that with some Difificulty We have 
counteracted the Acts of our Eastern Neighbors, and have got Mr. Jacob 
Cuyler appointed Deputy Commissary Genl. of Purchases in the Northern 
Department. As it is of infinite Consequence to the Wellfare of the Army

Philadelphia 24th June 1777 

Tuesday " 

My dear Friend, 

.... From many circumstances you may judge that our State and its 
interests were at a very low ebb in a certain assembly. To add to our 
misfortune several of our old friends â€” Hooper, Hughes, E Rutledge, 
Harrison, Reade, Stone, Chase, etc. etc. were absent and most of their 
seats filled with strangers. The affairs we had to conduct required great 
address, as some of them were embarassed with uncommon difificulties : 
my brethren indulged me in the cautious and deliberate plan which I 
thought necessary ; and in concealing even our feelings, by degrees we be- 
came acquainted with the new members to which the hospitable and cheer- 
ful manner we lived in contributed â€” for it was no time to consult par- 
simony. We made it a rule not to crowd our complaints upon Congress 
which would have fatigued and disgusted ; but to confine our attention to 
a single point till it was accomplished : keeping every other subject in the 
deepest reserve. 

We were told from several quarters that it was too late to expect any 
attention with respect to Schuyler. Indeed Congress had gone very far 
to make this embarassment inextricable; but that integrity, love of justice 
and candor, which ever distinguished this great Council when it consisted 
of a full representation, in the end, surmounted every obstacle, and the 
utmost of our wishes were answered.^ 

The Commissary's department was our next object : the flagrant abuses 
which had crept into it called aloud for reformation ; and we esteemed it 
of the utmost moment that the purchasing commissary who had our 
markets in his power should be a fellow citizen of approved abilities and 
integrity. A plan has accordingly been adopted ; not altogether so perfect 
as could be wished, but we shall not lose sight of its further improvement. 
Our friend Jacob Cuyler is appointed the purchasing commissary for the 
northern department which we esteem a public benefit.* 

The illiberal restraint put upon our Trade by our Eastern Brethren and 
a proper reprobation of so unfriendly a proceeding from the only authority 
which could have weight, claimed a share of our attention. I think we 
have some merit in obtaining the resolution of Congress upon this subject 
which is already transmitted to the Council of Safety. It's operation, tho' 
obvious, w^as not perceived by those whom it most concerned ; ^ and the 
House warmed by a pathetic description of our distresses, our persever- 
ance, and our merit, were disposed to give us every possible indulgence : 
of which the partial grant of 2000 bushels of salt when that commodity is 
so very scarce and dear, is no contemptible proof

My dear Sir 

What preceeds has lain by me for want of a good conveyance. This 
day - came on before a committee of the whole Congress the case of our 
Revolters on which we were heard with great attention. Some of our 
Eastern friends unluckily for them drew on the merits of our Title, tho' 
the Congress had only to do with the exercise of jurisdiction. Thus 
challenged I seized the opportunity of explaining the subject at large 
which i happened to understand much better than any of my opponents, 
tho' one of them boasted that he had expended two quires of paper upon it. 
I had the pleasure of observing that I made a suitable impression, and out 
of the House rec'd the compliments of several of the members for the 
light, they were pleased to say I had with perspicuity and candor, thrown 
upon a dispute which to that time had remained in utter obscurity. This 
explanation closed the debate : and the members of our State are desired 
to propose for consideration such resolutions as we think will be satis- 
factory to New York, and become the justice dignity and impartiality of 
Congress, unless an opportunity offers of sending forward these des- 
patches, you will probably know the event before they are closed.*

5 Dec. 2, 1.775, Congress authorized the committee of secret correspondence to 
secure " skillful engineers not exceeding four ". It was not how.ever until the beginning 
of 1777 that this commission was effected. On Feb. 13, 1777, Franklin and Deane 
entered into a contract with four officers of the royal corps of engineers of France, 
Lewis Le Begue Duportail (Chevalier Derford), Laumoy, Obry Gouvion, and Bailleul 
La Radiere, to enter the service of the United States, with stipulations as to rank. 
The contract with the three first mentioned is found in Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., IL 
269. The Journals, July 2 and 8, mention La Radiere as included in the same contract, 
but his name does not appear in the document as printed in Wharton. These officers, 
with exception of Laumoy, accompanied by a lieutenant and two sergeants, landed in 
New River, North Carolina, June 3 and proceeded to Newbern. where they obtained 
assistance from Governor Caswell to pursue their journey to Philadelphia. (See a 
letter from Joseph Leech, Richard Ellis, and Alexander Gaston to Governor Caswell, 
June 4, an undated letter from the Chevalier Derford, i. e., Duportail, to Governor 
Caswell, one from Governor Caswell to Governor Henry of Virginia, June 10, and two 
from Governor Caswell to Thomas Burke, June 10, 11, in A'^. C. State Recs., XL 486, 
492-495. Both the Newbern committee and Governor Caswell are in some error as 
regards the rank of these officers.) That Laumoy was not with the party appears from 
three facts: First, Duportail says in his letter to Governor Caswell: "We are just 
arrived in this place three officers of the Corps Royal of Engineers in France, that is 
to say one Lieutenant Colonel [Duportail], one Major [evidently La Radiere], one Captain 
of the Corps Royal of the Artillery of France [Gouvion], one Lieutenant, two Sergeants." 
Second, on July 8 Congress made Duportail a colonel. La Radiere a lieutenant-colonel, and 
Gouvion a major, ratifying the contract made with them by Franklin and Deane. The 
contract as regards Laumoy was not ratified until Oct. 2, when he was made a lieutenant- 
colonel. Third, in a letter to Washington, July 24 (no. 559, post), Lovell mentions that 
" the Chevalier Duportail, with M. La Radiere, M. Gouvion, and one other officer, who 
is left sick in the West Indies, were engaged by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Deane to come 
over to America." All these officers received further promotions Nov. 17, 1777. For 
further information concerning their careers, consult the Journals (passim), Heitman, 
Hist. Register, and Batch, The French in America. For the complications in which 
Congress was involved through the Du Coudray contract, see especially nos. 501, 514, 
ante, and nos. 530, 531, 535, 537- 539, S4i, 542, 559. Post.

tlie whole clieerfully resumed the debate; and the resolutions passed 
almost unanimously; for you'll observe they go upon general principles 
highly interesting and important to every State which yet directly apply to 
our case. The only contest was on Young's Address,' and that was 
ostensibly grounded on his death in the midst of the debate.* Compassion 
to his distressed family, no doubt, induced some of the members to wish it 
to be passed over in silence. You will observe however, that it was of 
great consequence to us to have this wicked production censured and ex- 
posed and this point was finally carried in our favor after a sharp conflict. 
The debate was spun out till after 4 o'clock and the Committee rose and 
agreed to finish it on Monday 

527. Robert Morris to Silas Deane.^ 

[Philadelphia June 29, 1777.] 

With respect to my Brother I shall deal very candidly with you, by 
declaring to you that I never was more shocked and hurt by any incident 
in my Life than at the manner in which you Gentlemen Commissioners at 
the Court of France have been pleased to mention him in Publick Letters, 
that you knew^ must be laid before Congress. These Letters arrived long 
before I had a scrip of a Pen from you on the Subject. It occurred to me 
instantly that I had unbosomed myself to you respecting him. That I had 
sollicited your Friendship in his favour and asked you to inform me fully 
and freely of his Conduct, That to all this I never had a word in Answer, 
and found your Name at the bottom of Letters blasting his Character in 
the most Publick manner and exposing me to Feelings the most pungent 
I ever knew, it also occurred to me that I had sollicited Doctor Franklin 
to Admonish and Advise him if he found it necessary, and shew him 
countenance if he proved deserving. From these Circumstances I really 
did expect that any complaints he merited would have been made to my- 
self in Private Letters giving me an Account of his Conduct and if it zvas 
necessary to remove him, from his employment, I could have done that so 
as to prevent any the least disservice to the Publick or his being unneces- 
sarily exposed. You will see that these sentiments were strong in my 
mind, when I wrote the Commissioners the ist April and they made so 
strong an impression on me at the Time your Letters were read in Con- 
gress that I got up instantly, gave my Brother his True Character, com- 
plained of his being so publickly exposed, told what my desires and Ex- 
pectations from you were, and added that by my Letters to you by Capt. 
Bell I had put him in your Power either to he confirmed in his employment 
or to be dismissed from it, as his conduct might require. I think the Letter

I wrote you by Capt. Bell respecting him must have convinced you that I 
did not wish him employed in the Publick Service if he did not deserve it. 

It must also convince you that a Publick Letter to Congress was not 
necessary to procure his removal if his conduct was not right, for you 
found me as ready to displace him, as you could wish, and I begin to fear 
that I was rather too forward in it; from what I now write you may 
naturally conclude I do not think myself in the least Degree beholden to 
Doctor Franklin or you for your Conduct towards this Young Man, and 
in Plain Truth I do not. However I do not Cherish resentment, and hope 
my Passion may be always subdued by Reason, and my Reason influenced 
by good Principles, therefore I mean nothing more than to let you know 
that I think those Publick Letters were cruel to my Brother and extremely 
unfriendly to myself. / shall inform him of them and if he has Spirit to 
resent them, I hope he ivill also have Judgment to do it properly. 

Perhaps I have flattered myself with the Expectation of more Friend- 
ship from the Doctor and you than I had a right to and shall therefore 
correct the Error in future. Thus much for what you say of him in 
Publick. as to what you write me of him in those Letters of the 4th Deer, 
and 5th January now before me, I thank you most sincerely for it and 
should do so had the Account of him been ten Times more Disagreeable. 
it is had enough, God knows, and what is worse I believe he deserves every 
Tittle of it. had these Letters reach'd me before the Publick Letters I 
should in some Degree have been prepared and probably should not have 
said any thing about him in Congress, hut even in that Case I should have 
thought in the same way of your Publick Letters, because I think it was 
totally unnecessary to mention him there; You refer me to Mr. Bromfield 
for further Particulars and Anecdotes respecting this Youth, and Mr. 
Bromfield has kindly referr'd me to all the Gentlemen from Virginia where 
he landed to South Carolina where he is gone by Land and has indus- 
triously communicated these Particulars and Anecdotes to every body he 
met with.^ ....

.... You wish to hear " how our Confederation goes on ". I do not 
wonder at your Anxiety to have it completed, for it appears to me to be 
a Matter of very great Importance. We every now and then take it into 
Consideration, but such a Variety of Affairs have continually demanded 
the Attention of Congress that it has been impracticable hitherto to get it 
through. There are but two or three things which in my Opinion will be

the Subjects of further Debate, and upon these I bch'eve most if not all 
the Members have already made up their Minds. One is, what share of 
\^otcs each of the States which differ so much in Wealth and Numbers 
shall have in determininjjf all Questions. Much has been said upon this 
weighty Subject, upon the Decision of which the Union of the States and 
the Security of the Liberty of the whole [depend]. Perhaps it would be 
more easy for a disinterested Foreigner to see, than for the united States 
to fix upon the Principles on which this Question ought in Equity to be 
decided. The Sentiments in Congress are not various, but as you will 
easily conceive, opposite. The Question was very largely debated a few 
days ago, and I am apt to think it will be tomorrow determind, that each 
State shall have one Vote, but that certain great and very interesting 
Questions shall have the concurrent Votes of Nine States for a Decision.* 
Whether this Composition will go near towards the Preservation of a due 
Ballance, I wish you to consider, for if your Life and Health is spared to 
your Country, you will have a great Share in the Determination of it

2 See the Journals, June 22, 23, 25. 26, July 2 ; also nos. 465, 488, 503, 507, ante, 
and no. 537, post. Although on July 2 Congress assigned " tomorrow " for consideration 
of the Articles of Confederation, the Journals do not record any discussion of the 
subject until Oct. 7 (see nos. 556, 558, post). Aug. 16 the following Monday (the i8th) 
was set for resuming the consideration, but the Journals contain no evidence that this 
was done (see however nos. 588, 616, post). On Tuesday, Sept. 2, a motion was made to 
devote a part of every day during that week to the Confederation, but the motion was 
negatived. Eliphalet Dyer's letter of Sept. 7 (no. 631, post) suggests that the subject 
was at that time under consideration, but no mention of the matter is found in the 
Journals until Oct. 2, when Congress again resolved to take the Articles into considera- 
tion "tomorrow morning" (cf. nos. 659, 671, post). Oct. 6 it was resolved to take into 
consideration " tomorrow morning " that part which related to the mode of voting, and 
on that day (Oct. 7) the question was determined. See no. 679, note 4, post.

(see nos. 517-520, 522, ante; also nos. 530, 543, post'). Apparently it was not until after 
July 5 that Trumbull was officially informed of the new regulations and of his election 
as commissary-general of purchases, for Hancock's letter transmitting the resolutions 
bears that date (Mass. Hist. Soc, Hancock Letter-Book, VI. 220; Library of Congress, 
Papers Cont. Cong., no. 58, pt. H., p. 216). July 9 Trumbull wrote to Hancock acknowl- 
edging receipt of his commission and postponing his decision as to its acceptance until 
he had conferred with the committee of Congress then at headquarters (Papers Cont. 
Cong., no. 78, vol. XXH., f. 259), July 19 he wrote to Hancock: "Inclosed I send 
you the Commission which Congress have honored me with lately as Commissary General 
of Purchases, and must beg leave to decline accepting the same, or acting under the 
Authority or rather, the want of Authority, of it. My reasons for declining, I have 
given to the Honble. Committee of Congress here, at large." (Ibid., i. 265.) The com- 
mission, dated Jiuie 18, is found ibid., f. 269. In the Connecticut State Library, Joseph 
Trumbull Papers, is the draft of a letter to President Hancock dated June 15 (that is, 
about three weeks before he had received his new commission), in which he offers his 
resignation to Congress. Inasmuch as the letter casts light upon the proceedings of 
Congress it is given here : 

" Camp Middlebrook, 15th June, 1777 
" Sir 

" It is now more than twelve months since I first applied to Congress for regulations 
in the Commissary Department which were not then compleated â€” immediately after I 
noticed you as President of Congress and His Excellency Genl. Washington as Com- 
mander in Chief of the Army of my design to resign the Office of Commissary General 
as soon as it could be done with safety to the Armyâ€” in the Month of Novr. last, I 
preferred a Memo, to Congress, merely respecting my own allowances in sd. Office, 
which has hitherto remained unnoticed â€” in April last, I was by Congress directed to 
attend them in Phila. which I Instantly did â€” and was called on by a Committee of 
Congress, for proposals in Writing for proper Regulations in the Commissary Depart- 
ment. I gave it to them in two days after, and pressed upon them the necessity of 
immediate attention thereto, on Accot. of my Assistants, who were all from different 
Causes discontented and uneasy, also on accot. of Vegitables and Vinegar and many 
other Matters fully pointed out in the sd. Proposals given in Writing â€” Afterwards 
I staid in Phila. four Weeks, and was never once called on by the sd. Committee, 
respecting sd. Regulations, nor was any thing that I could learn done therein, not- 
withstanding my most pressing representations to different Members of Congress, of 
the Necessity of the Affairs in sd. Department. 

" Since my return to Camp I find the discontent arising from 111 treatment here, among 
my assistants to be greater than I had before conceived it to be. This also I have 
represented to different Members of Congress by Letter â€” yet I find nor hear of any 
relief. 

" My Patience is wholly exhausted. Everything draggs heavily on, when all are dis- 
contended, and uneasy, and the Causes thereof wholly unattended to. Under all these 
disagreeable circumstances, it will I fear, be totally impossible for me to do my Duty, 
and Subsist the Army â€” therefore I must request the Honble. Congress, to dismiss me 
from their Service, and appoint Some Person, who will and can Serve them, with 
better abilities, tho' he cannot with more Integrity than I have done.

Accompanying this letter in the Trumbull Papers is a draft of his letter to Wash- 
ington, and also a draft of a letter to a personal friend, probably Elbridge Gerry. The 
latter is as follows :

Dear Sir 

I had intended to write a letter to you on this day somewhat minutely 
about our indoor political turns and twists, but I am too ill. 4 Engineers ^ 
having arrived on a Treaty with Messrs. Franklin and Deane, find the 
former one made between Deane and Du Coudray intirely inconsistent

child in the hands of Du Coudray, who has united, as under one direction, 
the Engineers and Artillerists, and made a Jews bargain for himself, and 
all the officers with him.

Or believe me you'll have the Army Starved. An Angel from Heaven could not go 
on long in my Situation, it is worse than the Jewish Brick Makers. You see by Mr. 
Ayletts last letter, what his Idea is of Continuing in the Service. I have seen two

Angels and men will justify me, I trust, in this measure.

The letter to Congress is not found among the Papers of Congress, or mentioned in

July I. Tuesday 

Yesterday ' the Committee of tlic whole House finished their proceed- 
ings concerning our Revolters and reported them to the House. An un- 
expected field of debate was opened and some of our neighbors (R. S ' 
in particular) discovered an earnestness and solicitude that did not belong 
to Judges between a State and its discontented members. But it was of 
little avail to object to what had been agreed to by the Committee of the 
whole House on the most solemn argument and debate of which I have 
been witness. The enclosed Resolutions were finally agreed to by Con- 
gress. The two first unanimously, all the rest by a considerable majority. 
What was most keenly opposed is the last Resolution respecting Young's 
Address ; * because it brought all the proceedings more pointedly to the 
case of New York. 

This appears to us to be a happy decision for our State which if not 
neglected must produce very salutary consequences. I should think it 
ought to be instantly circulated by hand bills throughout every part of the 
State : and that Commissioners should be sent into the three counties to 
announce the Resolutions and induce the people to conform to the new 
government and avail themselves of it's blessings. We did not think it 
necessary to press for a recommendation of Congress to these people to 
submit to our Jurisdiction: nor for the dismission of Warner's regi- 
ment.^ We thought we had obtained what was sufificient for the present 
it will depend on the impression these important decisions may make on 
that regiment and the disaffected at large; whether the former shall be 
discharged, and the latter enjoined more directly to a peaceable conduct. 
If either should be turbulent and be guilty of acts of violence or hostility, 
I presume on proper application Congress will interpose. A motion came 
from the Southward that the power of the Continent should be employed 
to suppress these insurgents ; Â® another from the same Quarter, that 
Warner's regiment should be dismissed : but it would not have been wise 
to hazard either of them : and a spirit of candor and moderation, which 
on this occasion distinguished your delegates, was of no little service in 
securing the other points which after the first debate we saw the fairest 
prospect of obtaining. As I said before these requisitions are kept in 
reserve for a proper season if they should become essential

Honourable Gentlemen 

Since our last we have applied to Commissary Trumbull to exchanj^e in 
the manner directed by Cong;ress the 2000 Bushells of Salt which they 
were pleased to grant for the Relief of our State. ^ As soon as we receive 
his Answer you shall know the Result 

We were Yesterday honourd with your favour of the [19 June] and 
immediately took the necessary steps to procure an Account of the State 
Prisoners sent to Philadelphia by our late Convention; and the manner 
of their discharge. It shall be transmitted to you by this Conveyance with 
the Reasons which indued the Council of Safety of this Commonwealth 
to use so little Ceremony in a Business which had been represented to them 
as of a very serious nature.' 

Congress between this and the 26th. of June have spent the greatest 
part of four days in considering the Claim of some of the Inhabitants of 
our State to a new Government independent of the Community ; and the 
Letters and Remonstrances of our late Convention and your honourable 
Council On that interesting Subject. The Principles upon which this 
ambitious Project was grounded were admitted to be of universal Concern 
to the general Confederacy, and they were considerd as peculiarly odious 
from the Attempt to confirm them by the grossest misrepresentation of 
the Resolutions of Congress. No Debate was ever conducted with more 
deliberation and solemnity; D[e]cision was such as in our Judgement 
ought for the present to be satisfactory. It does not it is true come up to 
the Requisition of our State, " that the Insurgents shou'd be recommended 
to a peaceable Submission to its Jurisdiction by the Authority of Con- 
gress ; and that Warner's Regiment shou'd be discharged ". But by totally 
reprobating the Idea that a Minority can establish an Independance of the 
Community of which they are members. By proclaiming the Duty of

it is pretended to be founded, or from any other Act or Proceeding of Con- 
gress. By the contemptuous Rejection of their Petition to be receivd and 
ranked as a free State; and to be represented by their own Delegates in 
Congress. By the Apology to the State of New York for raising Warner's 
Regiment, implied in the Explanation of the Motives which gave Rise to 
it. And by the severe Censure of Doct. Young's Address, encouraging 
these People to persevere in their Defection. By all these different Reso- 
lutions we think a substantial Foundation, on general and undenia[b]l[e] 
Principles, is laid either for reclaiming our Fellow Citizens to their Duty 
and a Submission to the Laws, by the Force of Reason and Perswasion ; 
and the Fear of offending a whole Continent; or shoud they distinctley 
persevere in their Revolt, for a future Requisition of the Aid of Congress 
to be administerd in such manner as the Opposition of the disaffected, and 
our own Circumstances may render expedient. We flatter ourselves there- 
fore that we shall meet with your Approbation and that our Country will 
be pleasd and benefited by the measures adopted on this Occasion. May 
we be permitted to suggest the Propriety of dispatching Commissioners 
without delay to circulate explain and enforce among our too aspiring 
Countrymen these Resolutions of Congress, and to seize the Advantage 
which the first Impression of unexpected disappointment, and Condem- 
nation from the only Tribunal they fear, may make on their Minds, in 
order to induce them to a Submission to your Jurisdiction. This appears 
to us to be the more necessary as Mr Roger Sherman of Connecticut, who 
brought in the Petition for these People to Congress, and has all along 
acted openly as their Advocate and Patron, and in the last Debate plead 
their Cause with a Zeal and Passion which he never discoverd in any other 
Instance, and which in a Judge between a State and some of its own mem- 
bers was far from being commendable. This Gentleman, we say, im- 
mediately on passing the Resolutions, procurd Copies, and having obtaind 
Leave of Absence, is already set out on his Journey to the Eastward.

Your several favours of the loth and nth ulto. have come to hand, and 
you may rely on my best attention to all your commands.* 

Mr. Penn is arrived, and has brought the papers necessary for obtaining 
the money, but the Treasury being very nearly exhausted of all former 
emissions I fear we must w-ait sometime before we can procure a sum from 
one lately voted, adequate to the demand. We have however obtained an 
order of the Treasury for three hundred thousand dollars to be delivered 
at Baltimore where the press and Signers are. and the Board of War are 
properly instructed to forw^ard it without delay. I observe the Resolve 
of the Assembly directs the Delegates to send forward 250,000, dollars 
and the residue of the 500,000 not drawn for under this Resolve, or pre- 
vious thereto. 

These difficulties occur. Are the 250,000 to be considered as part of 
the 500,000, or are they to be an additional demand ? Are the Delegates 
to send this money at the risque of the State, and not in the usual way

have been intended by the Assembly, and therefore 1 have ventured to 
advise its being sent at the risque of the Continent in the usual way. In 
this Mr. Penn concurs with me. The former question I can not decide 
upon, but until it is more clearly expressed must suppose it is intended as 
part of the 500,000 dollars.^ .... 

Nothing material has happened since I wrote you last, except the cele-

thing is remarkable; this day, and the 28th of June, memorable for the 
defence of Sullivan's Island, were both celebrated here, and at both a 
Hessian band of music which were taken at Princeton performed very 
delightfully, the pleasure being not a little heightened by the reflection that 
they were hired by the British Court for purposes very different from 
those to which they were applied.* July 7th. This moment I received

enquiry he is in Town, but have not been able yet to find him. I suspect 
he is chagrined at the cool reception he has met with, and keeps retired.* 

We have applied for the arms you wrote by us for, but find exceeding 
Difficulty in obtaining Them. I believe not a man southward or in the 
middle Department is supplied with an arm but by the Continent. We 
have done it thro zeal and strong attachment to the Cause, and yet They 
will not seem to know, believe or care anything about it, there is indeed 
such a thing as being righteous overmuch, and yet I can hardly repent 
that we have in such Influences fallen into this Error, but sho*^ N. E. be 
attacked and unarmed we sho*^ have reason, the matter is however referd 
to Genl. Washington, and Mr Sherman is to negotiate the Affair with him

are wanted, which must be allowed as some excuse for their lothness to 
comply.^

The Prices of every thing here are most alarmingly extravagant, much 
owing to the malicious Cunning of our worst Enemys, the Torys, and 
coinciding with the boundless avarice of the Merchants, whose Gain is

stronger a multitude of offices and officers are established and employed

Your Letter, being the third of this Instant July, moved Congress for the 
Sum requested, being sixty Thousand Pounds (meaning I presumed law- 
ful Money) or two hundred Thousand Dollars. Congress w^ere much 
surprised that so large a Sum should be requested so soon after the large 
Sum granted the State of Rhode-Island etc. The Gentlemen of the 
Treasury Board would hardly allow it possible you should have expended 
such very considerable Sums on Continental Account, and moved that the 
Sum of sixty Thousand Dollars only should be now granted. â€” especially 
as it was very probable the Continent would soon have Occasion for large 
Drafts upon the Eastern Loan Offices, if the Enemy's Movements should 
be into New-England, or up the North River, the latter of which from

Genl. Washington's Letters that Day received, seemed, and still appears 
most probable. I did not fail to state and urge, in the strongest Manner 
I was capable of, the Necessity and Expediency of this Supply, â€” The abso- 
lute Necessity you would otherwise be under of emitting a large Sum, the 
destructive Consequences of which we are all awakened to. I further 
suggested, what I fully imagine to be the Case, that a very great Part of 
this Sum would go into the Lx)an Office by Way of Discount with the 
State, that it could not be expected so large a Sum would in Fact be thrown 
into that Office. After a considerable Debate, the Consideration thereof 
was submitted to the Treasury Board. I applied there this Morning and 
inforced my Application with every additional Argument in my Power, 
and was very happy in obtaining a Report agreeable to my wishes, and 
upon which the inclosed Resolves passed Congress.'. . . .

7th. July 1777. 

Dear Sir, 

As you seemed particularly to wish when you left Philadelphia to be 
made acquainted with the proceedings in the Commercial and Foreign 
Committes, I would inform you that last Saturday Mr Geary Mr. W. 
Smith and Mr Heywood were joined to Messrs. Morris and Livingston, 
to the no small mortification of H â€” n.^ Geary pleaded hard to be excused 
but we would not allow of it till a proper opportunity.' This day we have 
the pleasure of knowing we shall soon have that opportunity to the double 
mortification of said H â€” ; for we this day find that Col R H Lee has 
not only rec'd the most honorable testimonies of approbation for his past 
conduct but was elected anew on the 24th. ulto. Old H â€” has whispered 
it all along on the road that Col Lee has ordered his overseer to demand 
produce or bullion for rent, but this was proved to be false by the fullest 
declaration of the overseer and other evidence. I feel exceedingly glad 
on this event,* and should be completely secure against the prevalence of a 
certain set, if a certain late resolute member of the Marine Committee Â° 
was about to return speedily from Portsmouth, one, who though quite as 
honest as his neighbors, yet did not confess ten times a day " I dont know

myself. 

We of the other Committee have sent an armed Sloop to France.^ The 
commissions of Wm. Lee and Izzard do not promise ratification of what- 
ever they may transact, but their proceedings on commercial treaties at 
Vienna Berlin and Tuscany are to receive our approbation and only to 
continue 12 years, though a treaty of friendship may be made outright 
for a longer period.^ 

I will aim to send you the issue of a plaguy altercation upon bringing 
on afresh the afifair of the New Hampshire Grants. I was unfortunately 
confined to my bed and G divided against S. A. on the two last resolves as 
did Elmore against Serjeant, the others of the two States being absent. 
You must know that Jemmy D. has got E â€” re fast. I do not however 
think that New York has much to boast of ; it is still a moot-point whether 
the people of the Grants belong to Massachusetts, New Hampshire or New 
York.\ . . . 

Du Coudray's treaty is not yet determined upon ; but I think there will 
be few advocates for confirming it. The 4 Engineers who were the only 
persons absolutely sent for, are arrived; and though modest men, upon 
a very modest treaty, yet possitively refuse to be under the command of 
Du C â€” y who has duped Deane to make him Commander in Chief of all 
the artillery and engineering through the States.Â® But this is only a part 
of our present distraction. For ist. Sulivan sends to know whether the 
report is true that Congress has ratified De C â€” y's claim, because if it is, 
he desires leave to resign. Two days after Green and Knox proceed in 
the same style. This is judged to be a military attempt to influence our 
free deliberations. For it is certain, they knew we had not settled the 
matter or General Washington would have rec'd the Resolves. If they 
chose to take it for a thing done why did they not ask leave to retire with- 
out any ifs. There is as much pulling and hauling, about rank and pay, 
as if we had been accustomed to a militarv establishment here i =;o vears.^**

Philadelphia July 7, 1777 
My dear Sir. 

I never before took hold of a Pen to write to my Friend General Green, 
without Pleasure, but I think myself obliged to do it now upon a Subject 
that gives me a great deal of Pain. 

The Three Letters from the Generals Sullivan, Green and Knox, have 
interrupted the Deliberations of Congress, and given many of the Mem- 
bers of it much Uneasiness. They thought themselves bound, in Honour 
and Justice, to the great Body of People whom they represent, to pass the 
Resolution which, before this Letter reaches you, will be communicated to 
you by General Washington. 

The Contract between Mr Deane and Monsr Du Coudray, is not yet 
decided upon. It is in itself one of the most delicate, and perplexing 
Transactions that has ever fallen in our Way : but those three Letters 
instead of relieving Us has only encreased our Mortification.^ .... 

Nothing in this affair gives me more Pain, than the Necessity, you have 
laid Us under of passing a Resolution, vi^hich will lessen your Characters, 
and diminish the Confidence w^hich the good People of America have in 
your Judgment, and attachment to the Principles of Liberty. But there

was not one Member of Congress who dared to justify the Letters, very 
few who could say a word in Mitigation or Excuse. It was universally 
considered, as betraying the Liberties of the People, to pass them by un- 
censured. Some were even for dismissing all three of you instantly from 
the service, others for ordering you to Philadelphia, under arrest to 
answer for this offence. 

The Resolution expresses an Expectation that some Acknowledgment 
or Apology will be made. I sincerely hope it will, for I think that on a 
cool Reconsideration of those Letters, the Impropriety and Danger of 
them must be manifest. I would be far from dictating to you, or giving 
advice unasked, but I really think, that a Declaration that you had no 
Intention to influence Congress, to contemn its Authority or infringe the 
Liberties of the People or the Priviledges of Congress, a Declaration that 
you have the fullest Confidence in the Justice of Congress and their 
Deliberations for the public good, is the least that you can do, provided 
you can do this with Truth and Sincerity, if not I think you ought to leave 
the Service.

Philadelphia July the 7th 1777 
Dear Sir 

I wrote you a few days agoe by Coll. Stewart which hope you have 
Recievd.^ we have in the course of a few days received some very unpolite 
letters from two or three Gentn. of high rank and Esteem in the Army viz 
Genlls. Green Sullivan and Knox, if they had prudently wrote the same 
Matter to any particular friend Member of Congress and he had divulged 
it to his brethren no offence would have been taken and it might have 
answered every valuable purpose, but to write to Congress as a Body while 
they had a matter under consideration (I mean the afifair of the Command 
of Monsr de Coudre) to dictate to or Influence their Conduct is looked 
upon by many as the highest Insult and Indignity and which they cannot 
pass by without the severest Censure, or otherwise must give up their own 
dignity and superiority to a few Gentn. of the Army, who will assume for 
the future to dictate and Influence all their measures, or if Congress do 
not at once yield they will resign their Commissions break up the Army 
and leave their Country to the total desolation and subjection of the 
Enemy, this is the Construction many put on their Conduct there is a 
number of us endeavour to palliate matters to soften the Asperity of 
Others tho all Condemn the manner of those Gentns. letters and the time- 
ing of them. Indeed they will have a bad effect on the matter under Con- 
sideration. I believe there would have been great caution and prudence in 
that affair we readily felt for those Gentn. and the Indignity it might at

least be Construed to be to place Monsr de Coudre in a rank superior to 
them it would have been opposed, and believe never would have taken 
place, but these Gentn. before the matter was so much as debated in Con- 
gress have thrown in their threats to them as a body that if they do this 
etc. they will immediately leave the Army, it embarrasses every free step 
both in debate and Conclusion, for if they now refuse which I dare say 
they before would have done to give de Coudre a Superior Command 
instead of being Imputed to their Justice and prudence it will be entirely 
attributed to their fear occasioned by the threats of those Gentn. and the 
Consequence will be, in every matter for the future we must be either 
Dictated to or threatned by the Army if we do not do this, or that, or 
just what they please, they will give up the cause or goe over to the 
Enemie, Sacrifice their Country, etc. 

they will easily see the Impropriety, and I believe they were in no danger 
before, am extremely sorry it has happened, how severe the conclusions 
will be I know not. some threaten hard, others Indeavour to moderate, 
the times are truly Critical and I think those Gentn. would not wish to 
lessen the authority Esteem or dignity of Congress, as their own and 
Countrys honor Safety and Liberty so much at present depend upon its 
being preserved, and whatever may be the result I hope they will take it 
patiently consider themselves as Imprudently (at least) giving an occa- 
sion, a few reflections will be for their honour and all may be set right, 
they must Consider their Country at Stake which I hope they preferr 
above every thing else even their own particular honor, or life, (I mean in 
the manner in which it may be effected in Compromising this matter which 
I hope would establish, instead of wounding it in the least, as they 
threaten to resign, it is a wonder if Congress dont tell them they may just 
when they please but I hope these Gentn love their Country too well. This 
is a most unhappy affair and our old Friend D[e]an has been in more In- 
stances than one, Imprudent to the last degree, he has brot us into the 
most unhappy Dilemma in several of his Contracts and Stipulations with 
Gentn sending over Swarms of Commanders Pensioners etc. I dare say 
no more at present upon the Subject and trust you will Improve what is 
said with caution and prudence, if these Gentn knew how Congress were 

embarrassed and plagued with D â€” ns Imprudence and his [.Jtc] 

they would rather pity than Insult. I did not think it best to write to either 
of the gentn. directly, but to you that you might deal out to them or either, 
any part you think proper, that they may be prepared. Numbers in 
C[ongre]ss will Meliorate and Soften down as far as possible, and hope 
those Gentn. will not be averse to some reasonable Concessions or at least 
if they are told as they threaten that they may give up their Commissions 
as soon as they please the Congress is ready to receive them yet they will 
persist to serve their Country, and preferr Jerusalem above their Chief 
Joy. I write this with the Utmost Friendly disposition and design to- 
wards them, hope all will be properly setled but the General Cause must 
not suffer, make the best of this letter for a few days then burn it hope 
you will see the Gentn. as soon as possible if in your Neighbourhood or

I received yours of the 7th this moment by express I wrote you by

a young Southern Officer who promised particular care in delivering it ' 
I remember I therein on the whole advised you to accept, with the advice 
of Mr Law and Coll. Williams but I then had no Idea of the plague and 
Trouble you had to goe through but hope it will not be of long duration 
the grounds of my advice was principally the publick good am Sensible 
many Inconveniences and much Confusion will arise on this New Regula- 
tion ' but hope it may not be of long duration and it must be Supposed 
if a person of your experience should leave the Army it most probably 
would be much worse, youll find by Mr Stewart that the wages of the 
Depty. and sub Commissys. are somewhat raised your Clerk from 40 to 
50 dolP pr month * tho am persuaded it is insufficient Considering his 
residence must be in Philadelphia but dare say it will soon be raised as 
believe the others will if on Trj^al it is found Insufficient it is a general 
observation in Congress that there is room to rise but no way to fall. I 

hope Mr Stewards arrival may- give you some relief these New 

regulations were all come into before my arrival I have since procured 
some addition to the Wages ' but it will take some time before the Subject 
can be taken up again without being Troublesome and a thousand other 
matters Crouding. it is impossible for me to Judge for you in this matter 
as I cannot be fully acquainted with the Troubles and difficulties you have 
to encountre. your letter to Congress seems to carrv with it an acceptance 
but suppose if you should find on Tryal that the embarrassments are too 
great to Struggle with, you may on giving seasonable Notice no doubt

your Direction, true it is, the Commissary General of purchases can only 
appoint a Clerk,Â® but it is also true, that he is exempted from Blame on

Honourable Gentlemen 

Since our Letter of the 4th. Instant the President at our Request has 
written to Commissary Trumbull on the Subject of the Exchange of the 
Salt appropriated to our State; and we hope this Formality will give 
Weight to our own Solicitations.'^ 

We transmit you the Secret Committee's order in our favour on Mr 
Mumford their Agent, for the Salt at Plymouth and our transfer to you. 
A Copy of our Letter to Commissary Trumbull we also enclose, from 
which last you'l be pleased to observe that for the Sake of Dispatch we 
have requested him to correspond on the Subject immediately with 
Yourselves.' .... 

We have taken the Liberty to retain your Letter to Congress of the 
17th. of June and the several Enclosures.* already have we employed so 
much of their Time on the Affairs of our State that good Policy strongly 
urges us to give them some Respite : and as the Subject matter of these 
Dispatches, tho' of some moment to our State, requires no immediate 
Decision, we flatter ourselves you will not be displeased with our Reserve. 
The Reasons you assign to shew that the Defence of Hudson's River 
ought to be a continental Charge appear to us to be very cogent, and they 
must always have great Weight : and w^e therefore make no Scruple in 
recommending that all these Expenses be charged to the Account of the 
Continent ; comprehending even such as may accrue subsequent to the late 
Resolutions of Congress pointing out a discrimination ; for had the Trans- 
action been fully explaind, we cannot think those Resolutions w^oud have 
passed.

My Dear Friend, 

.... I have the pleasure to inform you that Congress have adopted 
Sundry resohitions respecting the Insurgents in the Counties of Glouces- 
ter, Cumberland and Charlotte, which if our new Legislature acts with 
spirit and wisdom will I think be attended with happy Effects. We trans- 
mit them by this Oj)p(irtunity tti the Council of Safety." 

I believe no matter has ever been more solmenly argued in Congress 
than this. The house were in Committee for three days, and very warm 
opposition was given to [sic] by some of our Eastern friends against the 
resolution for dismissing the Petition of Jonas Fay etc and that answer- 
ing Dr Youngs incendiary production. Mr Sherman was quite thrown 
off his bias, and betrayed a warmth not usually learnt within the Walls 
of Vale College 

I am sorry to inform you that Col R : H. Lee is returning to Congress 
crowned wath Laurels.^ His smooth discourse and art of Cabal have 
blunted the Edge of his countrymen's resentments and they have loaded 
him with encomiums on his patriotism and attention to business, which 
he modestly says, he is conscious of deserving, for particulars I refer 
you to the Pennsilvania Papers.* I suppose he will return here more 
rivited than ever to his Eastern friends; I assure you they lost in him no 
contemptible Ally 

At present there are no very great matters in which our state is partic- 
ularly interested before Congress ; and indeed if they were Mr Morris ^ 
can supply my place with great advantage to the reputation of the State, 
as well as his ow^n. His coolness of temper, and happy vein of Irony are 
qualifications, which would render him a very powerful antagonist to Mr

Philadelphia July loth 1777. 
Gentlemen, 

I do myself the Honour to enclose to you Copies of sundry Papers, 
transmitted to Congress by the State of North Carolina, accompanied with 
the Resolution of Congress founded thereon.^ From these you will learn, 
that a Brig belonging to two Gentlemen of that State, Mr Smith and Mr. 
Hewes, was some Time ago captured by a certain Brazilla Smith, Com- 
mander of the Privateer Eagle, said to be owned by Mr Elijah Freeman 
Payne, of the Town of Boston. The Congress therefore have recom- 
mended it to the State of Massachusetts Bay, to enquire into the Matter ; 
and unless the Master and Owner can shew sufficient Cause to the con- 
trary, to order full Restitution to be made, and the offenders to be pun- 
ished. I beg Leave to refer your Attention to the Resolve and also to the 
Papers. 

Mr Hewes, who is the Bearer hereof,^ and one of the Owners of the 
Brig, was a Member of Congress for a considerable Length of Time in 
the Representation from the State of North Carolina. From the enclosed 
Memorial you will perceive the Sense his Constituents entertain of his 
Merit â€” to which I shall only add, that his Conduct as an inflexible Patriot 
and his Liberality as a Gentleman, justly entitle him, not only to their 
Protection, but to the Notice and Protection of every good Citizen, and 
Friend of America.

1 hope Brother Geary will be disposed to do every thing proper to make 
those regulations practically useful about which he has already had a vast 
deal of perplexity. I shall be very sorry if you cannot have the aid of 
two such men as Aylet and Wadsworth.' You know how little I like 
the slow manner of conducting business in large popular assemblies. I 
do not better like the short way in which the Depy. Issuers have managed 
their matters : if the army was not in such a very critical state just at 
this time I should rejoice to have every man, heretofore employed in 
that way, dropped, and others found to whom I would give lo pr Ct. 
rather than retain the old ones at the lowest Salary. Mr Hoops * is an 
example to them which they ought to follow. He will take up at present 
tho' he does not think to continue. He accompanies the Committee ; so 
that I hope you will have some Leisure to mend a bad scheme.

The enclosed Resolve of Congress recommending it to your state to 
send such reinforcements of militia to the Armies under generals Wash-

at this juncture, that I am persuaded any arguments to induce you to 
comply with it will be unnecessary. From the Continental battalions not 
being compleated agreeably to the original plan there is indeed an abso- 
lute necessity for adopting the measure in our present situation. Give 
me leave therefore most earnestly to request your compliance with this 
requisition of Congress, as the only effectual mode of checking the 
progress of our enraged and cruel Enemies.^

.... We have letters from General Schuyler ^ in the Northern De- 
partment giving us an Account of the untoward Situation of our Affairs 
in that Quarter and I confess it is no more than I expected, when he was 
again instrusted with the Command there. You remember it was urged 
by some that as he had a large Interest and powerful Connections in that 
Part of the Country, no one could so readily avail himself of Supplys for 
an Army there, than he. A most substantial Reason, I think, why he 
should have been appointed a Quartermaster or a Commissary. But it 
seems to have been the prevailing Motive to appoint him to the Chief 
Command ! ^ You have his Account in the inclosed Newspaper, which 
leaves us to guess what is become of the Garrison. It is indeed droll 
enough to see a General not knowing where to find the main Body of 
his Army. Gates is the Man of my Choice. He is honest and true, and 
has the Art of gaining the Love of his Soldiers principally because he is 
ahvays present with them in Fatigue and Danger. But Gates has been

there is so many fond of their New plan that it is difficult to make them 
attend to the Objections against and cannot bare so soon to throw up 
What they have entertained so great a fondness of but however they soon 
agreed to send a Com**^^ of Congress to goe to the Army and see and 
hear and report.^ the Congress is very thin and most Gentn. had a Very 
great Aversion to goe on this business. Except Mr Gerry I think there 
could scarce been one more unsuitable. Mr Livingston was chose one 
principally because he was gone that way before and would be in the 
way.* I much fear the Consequence arising from this New^ Regulation 
but hope for the best every thing must be Endured before the Army 
must fail it is said in Congress by some that you must goe on your Old

So long ago as Deer. 2d 1775 direction was given by Congress to the 
committee of secret correspondence to procure from Europe four good 
Engineers. This was not however accomplished till the 13th of last 
Febry, when the bearer the Chevalier du Portail, with Mr. La Radiere, 
Mr. Gouvion and one other Officer who is left sick in the West indies, 
was engaged by Doctor Franklin and Mr. Deane to come over to Amer- 
ica.^ I beg your Excellency to observe well that these are the only 
Officers, of any Species, who have been procured from abroad by express 
direction of Congress. And this I do, because I am about to furnish you

point of equity well worthy of your Excellency's attention. The Corps of 
Enijfineers is very honorable in France; and officers from it are sought 
by ditTerent european Powers. These Gentlemen who are come over into 
our service made an agreement with our Commissioners to rise one 
degree from the rank they held at home, upon a supposition that the 
practice of luirope had been regarded here. But when they arrived, they 
found instances very dillereiit wth. respect to officers in all other corps. 
It was their mishap also to see a Major of artillery affecting to be exalted 
four ranks, as a Chief in his proper line and theirs also. They made a 
representation of these circumstances and appealed to the Equity of Con- 
gress. But, they had arrived at a time when the Infatuation of some 
here and the wild conduct of one abroad had rendered a Spirit of refor- 
mation absolutely necessary as to the point of rank. The ingenuous, 
however, must own that there is singular hardship in the case of these 
Gentlemen. The only officers ever sent for by us, procured by the real 
political Agents of Congress, coming out with the good wishes of the 
french Ministry, being of undoubted rank and ability in their Profession, 
find themselves in the Dilemma of becoming the first examples of our 
new reforming Spirit, or else of going home during a Campaign, which 
their high sense of honor w^ill not allow. But, tho' the Chevalier du 
Portail was not made a Brigadier, yet it appeared too gross to expose 
him to be directed in his peculiar line by such as w-ill readily acknowledge 
his pretensions by regular education and discipline to be greatly Superior 
to their own. His commission prevents this, and enables him so to dis- 
tribute, in work, the others who came with him, as to prevent them, who 
have been within a few^ months as long in service as himself, from being 
interfered with by such as never belonged to the royal corps of Engineers 
in France, or perhaps but a very short time to any other. Your Excel- 
lency cannot but wonder at the strange manner of wording the com- 
mission. I shall explain it with the greatest freedom. Mr. Du Coudray ^ 
being employed as a good artillery officer to examine the arsenals in 
France, to see \vhat cannon, etc. could be spared from them, acted with 
great Industry in that emplo3'ment and much seeming regard to america. 
In the course of his transactions betw^een the Ct. de St. Germain and Mr 
Deane, he was not blind to perceive that he might take occasion to serve 
himself. Besides being paid for his trouble and Expenses in France he 
procured an agreement from mr. Deane wxh. has already been shown 
to yr. Excellency, and has affected you, doubtless, with the same surprise 
and indignation which it has excited in others, almost w'ithout a single 
exception. I shall omit any remarks upon that treaty, or a long too- 
ingenious memorial presented to Congress with it, except such as are 

strictly connected with the occasion of this letter. Mr. Du C having 

created himself to the Command of Artillery and Engineers, persuaded

and the Journals, passim. Cf. nos. 561, 565, 576, 581. 586, 632. 648, post. The contract 
between Deane and Du Coudray was repudiated by Congress, Sept. 8. Cf. the Journals, 
Aug. 13. See, further, letters of the committee of foreign affairs to the commissioners 
in Paris, Oct. 18, Dec. i, 1777, Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 412, 437.

Mr. Deane that it would be impossible to get any from the military corps 
of Engineers now called royal because their Demands would be so ex- 
orbitant ; and that it would be also unnecessary, because we ought not to 
build fortified Places in America to serve as secure Holds to our Enemy 
when once taken from us; and that therefore, a few Bridge and Caiise- 
zvay-makers would answer all the ends of military Engineers. Such he 
brought with him; who were quite ready to fall under the command of 
an artillery direction ; when not the lowest officer of the royal corps of 
Engineers would have submitted to such a novel pretension. It is need- 
less to enquire whether it be true that Mr. Deane acknowledged he had 
been surprised into his uncouth compact. It is sufficient that Doctr. 
Franklin made an after one, which Mr. Deane also signed. Is not this 
in fact tantamount to a disavowal of the first treaty so far as relates to 
the orders of Congress? For, if those orders were fulfilled by the first, 
why was a second treaty made ? The agents show that there had been a 
deception; or that there had not been any attempt to follow the instruc- 
tions of congress as to Engineers, in all the train attending Mr. Du 

C Another remark may not be impertinent here. As these four 

engineers showed their treaty to the Count de St. Germain, to whom they 
have also written from hence, it cannot be supposed that he would have 
permitted a Lt Colol. of the royal corps of Engineers and two old Majors 
of the same to come over hither, to be under the immediate command of 
a young Major of Artillery. It is not to be conceived. From whence, I 

conclude that Mr. Du C never let his exorbitant and whimsical 

treaty be known to that Minister of the War Department, who must have 
been shocked at the confusion of corps in the principles of the contract. 
Excuse me, dear General, I will not again wander from the point which 

I said I would explain. Mr. Du C has given full scope to his species 

of Ingenuity, here, as in the Neighbourhood of Mr. Deane. I have been 
told that he has said, if he could not be employed himself, he would bring 
it about that these others should not. This may be an absolute False- 
hood. But, I will own it comes the nearest of anything, which I can 
conceive of, to explain the delays which have taken place in regard to 
these Engineers, who ought to have been sent to your Excellency long 
ago. They have remained subject to the crucifying expences of this city, 
because their employment seemed to interfere wth. Mr. Du Coudray's 
Pretensions, tho' those very Pretensions had been rejected. Your Ex- 
cellency would doubtless smile, if you should ever hear, that even a num- 
ber of Peasants disputed 3 days about the difference between the conse- 
quences of a man's being Colonel in Chief, or First Colonel, or Colonel 
to take rank and Command of all heretofore appointed, or Colonel com- 
mandant of Engineers. Would not a Brigadier or Major General of 
Engineers alike annul the supremacy of the differently worded commis- 
sions? Or rather, do not the 4 different modes give like command? I 
shall pass from rank to pay. These Gentlemen not only far from the 
prophesied exorbitancy in demand of rank, never received one shilling 
in France as Gratification; tho' others who were not sent for received 



4 

large sums, and claim pay from their embarkation, and even pensions for 
life. But Doctr. Franklin, supposing^ it would be less trouble to himself 
and more agreeable to the Engineers to see to their own passages, stipu- 
lated their pay from the 13th. of Febry. As no Regulations have yet 
been made in regard to Cavalry or Engineers, these Gentlemen have 
received 5 months pay as Infantry; which will not refund the expenses 
of their voyage. I am really uneasy when I find manly honourable Inten- 
tions do not meet with at least equal emoluments with artful suspicious 
tricking contractors. If these Officers do not walk to camp, it is not 
because they were furnished by the Board of war with horses upon my 
application for them : And yet the nature of their Profession demands 
a provision of this Kind. Are they suddenly to reconnoitre a Camp, a 
River, a shoar, or a whole neighbouring country thro' which an army is 
to march, and to make the speediest return to the Generals, on foot? I 
trust your Excellency when asking for Engineers had ideas of something 
beyond what the sinister views of an ambitious foreigner has sought to 
inspire us with here ; which is forming a causeway, or cutting a ditch or 
planking a bridge. And I shall consequently rest satisfied that you will 
receive the Officers now presenting themselves to you, and secure to them 
such honors and emoluments as you shall find them to merit from their 
education and abilities exemplified under your command. 

No one has been more backward than I in desiring to see foreigners 
in our service, to the slight of my countrymen. And, except Engineers, 
I could not admit the thought of our wanting any military strangers 
other than one or two veteran Adjutants or Majors, wdio know our lan- 
guage well, and could serve as instructors-at-large to our spirited and 
well-attached young american Officers. 

I wish these Engineers could speak english better than they do; but 
they can receive orders and give them in english, and will speedily learn 
to speak. 

I hope your Excellency will not think amiss of the freedom I have 
taken at this time both as to the matter of my letter and the interruptive 
length of it. I do not write officially, as of the Committee on foreign 
Applications. In that capacity I have more than once communicated to 
you proceedings of Congress in a Style which might lead you to mis- 
conjecture my individual opinion. I write as a Friend to my Country 
and the Reputation of it's Congress its Army and its Agents abroad. 
I write as being well acquainted with your Excellency, or, in other words, 
as thinking I know you. In short, I write because I had determined it 
to be my DUTY so to write. That Path once determined, I never ask 
myself whether there may not be a Lion in the way. 

After the important kindnesses which your Excellency has done me, 
I so far forgive the late injury of your apologizing for a short answer 
WTitten by one of your hurried family, as not to revenge myself, by 
entreating you to excuse my rough unco pied sheets to a violent headache.

2 The report of the board of war had apparently been taken into consideration 
for the first time July 19, and resumed on the 24th. The report was based on a plan of 
George Morgan, June 6, 1776, submitted to General Arnold, together with a letter of 
Arnold, July 5, 1777, and a further memorandum of Morgan, July 6. (The report of 
the board of war and the other papers mentioned are in the Papers of the Continental 
Congress, no. 147, vol. I., flf. 251, 255. 259, 263.) The members of the board of war 
who were present July 10 (see the Journals, July 19, p. 567 n.) were John Adams, 
Benjamin Harrison, James Wilson, George Qymer, Samuel Adams, and William Duer. 
Of these all except John Adams and Qymer, from whom no remarks are quoted, appear 
in Thomson's Notes as advocating the expedition, as does also Robert Morris. The 
principal critic of the project was Henry Laurens, who gives a more explicit account of 
his part in the discussion in his letters to Mcintosh and Rutledge (nos. 584. 586, post).

Sir 

I arrived here in good Health the 20th. being stopt two days on the 
Road by foul wather : I Performed the journey in 12 Days, on my 
joining the Congress I found them worried with Petitions from a grate 
Numl)er of French gentlemen for commissions to serve in our army to 
be made generals and none less then Colonels and that our agents in 
france and general Washington in the camp were not less troubled with 
them.^ 

The first oppurtunity we had we presented the Petition of Mr. Phill- 
brook ' and that of our State to the Consideration of Congress which was 
referred to the treasury board and this morning we are to have a hearing 
before them. By what we Can learn from the members and the ex- 
hausted state of the Treasury, at this Time we despair of success on the 
Petition of the State, tho it seems to be the wish of Congress that the same 
thing which is asked by us might be done with each of the thirteen United 
States. However if we should fail now we shall embrace the first favour- 
able oppurtunity to try them again and do every thing in our Power to 
accomplish so desirable an end. I am not without hopes of obtaining a 
grant for Mr. Phillbrook as at Present I have heard no objection to it. 

The Loss of Ticonderoga considerably alarmed Congress as they were 
informed but a Little Time before by General St. Clair that it wase in a 
good state of defence an Enquiry into that affair is thought necessary.*

My dear Sir 

I receive! your favor of the 26th of June and also one from Colo Crafts ^ 
of the same Date. I wrote to him by the Return of the Post and desired 
him to communicate the Contents to you. I conversd with Mr. J. A ' upon 
the Subject of your Letter, and we venturd, both of us, to step out of the 
Line of strict order in a Debate in Congress the other day, to bring your 
Regiment of Artillery into View. It occasiond a Conversation in the 
House in which we had a Opportunity of acquainting the Members of the 
long Standing of that Regiment and the Seniority of its Officers. But 
still it was considerd as a Regiment raisd by a State and not by the Con- 
tinent. And though we caused the Merit of it to be well understood and 
it was acknowledgd in the House, the Difficulty of altering the Regulation 
you refer to appeard so evidently in the Minds of the Gentlemen, that we 
waved making any Motion at tjiat time, because we apprehended that the 
Issue would be unfavorable. Indeed I am of Opinion that Congress will 
not be induced to make the Alteration you wish for, until it shall become 
a Continental Regiment. In that Case, I am apt to think there would be 
no Difficulty with Regard to the Seniority of other Regiments which have 
been raisd since, over yours. But till that is done, it is feared that an 
Alteration in this Instance would cause Discontent in other States, where 
it is said there are Instances similar. A Regiment of Artillery raisd in this 
State under Command of Colo Procter * was lately taken into Continental 
Service and the Commissions were dated at the time they were raisd. It 
was upon this Occasion that Colo Crafts Regiment was mentiond ; and I 
suppose that Regiment wd be admitted on the same terms. But I think 
I foresee an insuperable Obstacle in that Case. If any thing can be done 
consistently with the general Service, to show Honor, but especially to 
do Justice to the Regiment of Artillery in Boston, I shall not fail to push 
it as far as I may have Influence

Honour". Gentlemen 

We have the Honour of your favour of the 17th. Instant with the 
several Enclosures, to which we shall pay all due attention.^ 

We had flatterd ourselves that having happily accomplished the various 
matters given us in Charge by our late honourable Convention, our 
Anxiety relating to our own internal affairs woud have been for some time 
at least relievd. But the misfortunes in the northern Department, and the 
fresh attack which is made upon General Schuyler in consequence of them, 
renew our Difficulties. The Eastern States openly affirm that their Troops 
have no Confidence in General Schuyler and assign this as the Reason that 
they have not marched to his Assistance. They therefore insist that he 
as well as Genl St. Clair shall be recalled and General Gates again ap- 
pointed to the Command : or that Congress must Take upon themselves 
all the Consequences which may attend a Refusal of this Proposition. 
You see Gentlemen the Delicacy of our Situation. If the Eastern Dele- 
gates carry their point the world is left to conclude not only that General 
Schuyler is unworthy of the Command; but that if the late change had 
not taken place, Ticonderoga, by the abilities of Genl Gates, might still 
have been preserved. In what Light your Delegates and the State by 
whose Authority they interposd, will be represented, on this View of the 
Case, is sufficiently obvious. But supposing General Schuyler, after this 
warm application for his Removal, should be continud in the Command ; 
and the Eastern States be backward in supplying their Militia; and the 
Calamities of the Country in that Quarter encrease, Woud there, under 
these Circumstances, be any End to Clamour and Reproach ? ^ 

It is not easy to determine the Line of Conduct we ought to pursue 
especially as we cannot be assisted by your advice, nor strengthend by 
your authority.

July 29th. 1777 
My Dear Sir, 

.... Your ideas about Ticonderoga you will find by my letters of last 
Tuesday ^ are similar to those which we had here. But will you believe 
that the same obstinacy which withstood the sending Schuyler to Head 
Quarters in the Jersies 7 weeks ago, now also withstands calling him 
hither * to give an account of our affairs in the Northern Department 
and of the causes of the relinquishment of Independence, to say nothing 
of the Western part. He writes that the Tories will all join Burgoyne 
and the timid Whigs and Six Nations of Indians and that the Eastern 
Militia will not stay with him ; yet we are not to send a more fighting 
popular General in his place. Just such contradictory letters as you and 
your brother mention, we received here. If the Eastern States do not 
muster all possible proofs that they have done as well at least as others, a 
number in Congress with the Northern Council of War and Schuyler, and 
more than one in the Jersies, will cry out " New England alone is to 
blame " * 

In addition to the perplexities wdiich I have before mentioned to you 
about French Treaties made by Deane we have a fresh quantity from the 
arrival of 2 Majors General two Brigadiers, 2 Lt. Cols. 2 Majors, 3 Cap- 
tains and two Lts. created and ranked 7th. Nov last and ist. of Deer, to 
whom have been advanced 16,000 livs. ^ gratuity and half pay." Ought

2 Tuesday was the 22d, but probably the letter of July 21 (no. 556, ante) is 
meant. The plural " letters " may be an error of the Force copyist.

delegates was first to have Schuyler called to Philadelphia, but was afterward changed 
to have him sent to headquarters. Cf. no. 571, post.

5 The reference is evidently to the group of French officers who came over with 
Lafayette, although the category here set down does not altogether accord with the 
lists in the Deane contracts. Dec. i and 7, 1776. See Wharton, Rev. Dipt. Corr., IL 
218-221 ; Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser., IIL 1089-1091 ; Kapp, Life of Kalb, pp. 296-297. 
Lafayette as well as Kalb is given the rank of major-general in the last-mentioned agree- 
ment. There are no brigadiers in either list. 

Lafayette's party landed near Georgetown, South Carolina, June 13, and arrived in 
Philadelphia July 27. See Kapp, Life of Kalb, pp. 108-113; Tower, Lafayette in the

566. Thomas Burke to the Governor of North Carolina/ 

Philadelphia, July 30th, 1777. 
Dr. Sir: 

.... No new accounts have arrived from the Northern Department 
since my last. Our affairs there give us great uneasiness. The loss was 

Records, XI. 502. Sparks, who probably obtained the facts from Lafayette himself, 
gives the following account of Lafayette's application to Congress : 

" When Lafayette arrived in Philadelphia he put his letters into the hands of Mr. 
Lovell, Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. He called the next day at the 
Hall of Congress, and Mr. Lovell came out to him and said, that so many foreigners 
had offered themselves for employment, that Congress was embarrassed with their 
applications, and he was sorry to inform him there was very little hope of his success. 
Lafayette suspected his papers had not been read, and he immediately sat down and 
wrote a note to the President of Congress, in which he desired to be permitted to serve 
in the American army on two conditions ; first, that he should receive no pay ; secondly, 
that he should act as a volunteer. These terms were so different from those demanded 
by other foreigners, and presented so few obstacles on the ground of an interference 
with American officers, that they were at once accepted. His rank, zeal, perseverance, 
and disinterestedness overcame every objection, and he was appointed a major-general 
in the American army more than a month before he had reached the age of twenty." 
Writings of Washington, V. 454 (Appendix L). See the Journals, July 31; also no. 
603, post. 

The Chevalier Du Buyssons, one of the officers of Lafayette's party, gives in his 
journal the following account of the matter: 

" We arrived on the 27th of July, in the morning. After having brushed ourselves up 
a little, we went to see the President of Congress, to whom we presented our letters 
of recommendation and also our contracts. He sent us to see M. Moose [Morris ? ], 
a member of the Congress, who made an appointment to meet us on the following 
day at the door of the Congress; and in the mean time our papers were read and 
examined. The next day we were punctual in keeping our appointment, but we were 
made to wait a long time. Finally M. Moose appeared, with another member, and said 
to us, ' This gentleman speaks French very well, and he is intrusted with the matters 
that concern people of your nationality; hereafter your communications will all be with 

him.' He then went in, and the other member, M. [Mr. Lovell], talked with us 

in the street, where he left us, after having treated us, in excellent French, like a set 
of adventurers. He ended his speech by saying, ' Gentlemen, have you any authority 
from Mr. Deane ? We authorized him to send us four French engineers ; but, instead 
of that, he has sent us Mr. du Coudray and some men who pretend to be engineers but 
are not, and some artillerists who have never seen service. We then instructed Mr. 
Franklin to send us four engineers, and they have come. It seems the French officers 
have a great fancy to enter our service without being invited. It is true we were in 
need of officers last year, but now we have experienced men and plenty of them.' 

" This was our first reception by the Congress, and we did not know what to think 
of it; indeed, it would be impossible for any one to be more stupefied than we were. 
Would it have been possible for M. de La Fayette, M. de Kalb, and M. de Mauroy, 
followed by ten officers recommended as we had been, and secretly approved, if not 
openly avowed, by the Government of France, to expect such a reception as this? 

" We determined to wait and to discover the cause of this affront, if possible, before 
making any complaint. We attributed it, and rightly, to the misconduct of certain of 
our compatriots who had preceded us ; for we soon heard of the bad behavior of several 
of them, and the discredit which their actions had thrown upon letters of recommenda- 
tion brought by them from our colonies, and we discovered that certain other things 
also had had an influence in this connection." Tower, Lafayette in the Revolution, 
179-180; Doniol, Histoire de la Participation de la France a l'Â£tablissetnent des Â£tats- 
Unis dAmerique, III. 215 et seq.

certainly occasioned by the want of suflicicnt well appointed force, and as 
the Eastern States were to supply the Troops for that station, they are 
very solicitious that it should be thought the fault of the officers, who in 
reality could not have done more than they did with the force in their 
hands. They are unwilling that it should l3e thought they have not the 
force they have always pretended to ; and altho' it must be and is admitted 
they have exerted themselves as much as any State, yet they are very 
unwilling to admit that any of our misfortune has happened through a 
weakness which they only share in common with the rest. The result I 
suppose will be, that the officers must be unjustly disgraced.* Upon the 
whole of our affairs, they bear rather a promising aspect, and could we, 
by general taxing, or any other means, establish the credit of our money, 
every campaign would give us more command of the war. I shall not 
trouble you, Sir, with any more at present. I have the honor to be with

The Congress have this day receiv'd intelligence that the fleet of the 
enemy, consisting of two hundred and twenty-eight sail have arrived at 
the offing in the capes of Delaware and are standing in for the bay with a 
fair wind. No doubt therefore can remain that the city of Philadelphia 
is the object of their destination and attack. 

Upon this occasion their is no necessity of using arguments to animate 
you. it is sufficient to mention the importance of this city to all America, 
and that the preservation of it will be attended with the most extensive 
consequences in favour of our country. I must therefore most ardently 
entreat you to call out your militia with the utmost expedition, that they 
may be in readiness to repel any invasion of your state, or to assist in the 
defence of the state of Pennsylvania which is immediately threatened with 
an attack from the enemy. I beg leave to request your attention to the

568. Samuel Adams to James Warren.* 

Philadelphia, July 31, 1777 
My dear Sir, 

It is a long time since I had the Pleasure of a Letter from you. I have 
not heard your opinion of the Evacuation of T[i]conderoga.^ You are 
doubtless as much chagrind as I am. It is ascribd to different Causes. 
Congress is determind that the true Reasons shall be enquired into, and 
the Conduct of the General officers. Schuyler's Friends are endeavoring 
to clear him from all Blame, because, say they, he was not there. This is 
true. And as it was well known he had never been used to keep his own 
Person near his Army, perhaps it may be pertinently asked, Why he was 
pitched upon to take the Command.^ Your Delegates, I can assure you, 
were utterly against it. And, notwithstanding it was publishd in one of 
the Boston News papers, said to be warranted by a Letter from this City, 
that General Schuyler had the entire Confidence of Congress, there were 
five only of eleven States present, in favor of it. The Paper I think was 
of the 5th of June.* I wish I could know who gave the Letter to the 
Printer. In order, I suppose, to give Credit to that Letter, there was 
another Publication in the Papers here, informing the World, that when 
he set off for the Northern Department, he was accompanied by the Pres- 
ident and other Members of Congress, which I take for granted is true.^ 
These are trifling political Manuvres similar to those which we have 
formerly seen practicd in the Massachusetts Bay, when a Prop was wanted 
for a sinking Character. You may think them not worth your Notice ; 
Excuse my troubling you with them. Cunning Politicians often make 
use of the Names of Persons, and sometimes of the Persons themselves, 
who have not the least Suspicion of it, to serve their own designs. When 
I mentiond five out of Eleven I should have explaind my self. There were 
five States for the Measure, four against it and two divided. Had not the 
State of Rhode Island been at that Juncture accidentally unrepresented, 
there would have been an equal Division, and the Measure would have 
been prevented." The most important Events may sometimes depend upon 
small Circumstances. Some Gentlemen of the State of N. Y. are exceed- 
ingly attachd to G. Schuyler. They represent him as Instar Omnium in

* In the Independent Chronicle (Boston), June 12, 1777, is found the following 
" Extract of a Letter from Philadelphia, May 27 " : " General Schuyler will return to

been fully enquired into, and the Congress have given very honorable Proofs of their 
good opinion of him." Cf. nos. 560A, 562A, ante.

as I have for a lunj^ time, excellently well qualified for a Commissary or 
(Juartermaster, Tlie N. E. Delei^ates were (perhaps one excepted) to a 
Man against his having the Command of that Army. But of this I will 
write particularly in another Letter. 

I am not willing to prejudge, but I must say, it is difficult to reconcile 
the sudden Evacuation of Ty. with the previous flattering Letters of 
General St. Clare. In one of his Letters written but a few days before he 
says " My People are in the best Disposition possible and I have no Doubt 
about giving a good Account of the Enemy if they shall think proper to 
attack us." ^ He has been esteemed here a good officer and in his Letter 
he bespeaks the Candor of the Publick till he can be heard. Pains will be 
taken to lay the Blame upon the N. E. States, for not furnishing their 
Quota of Men. I wish therefore you would procure for me an authentick 
Account of the Number of Men, both regular and Militia sent to the 
Northward from our State, and how they were cloathd and armd. You 
may remember that Congress recommended to the Eastern States, some 
time I think in December last, to send a Reinforcement of Militia to 
Ticonderoga, to remain there till they could be replacd by Continental 
Troops then raising.^ I have never been informd of the Effect of that 
Recommendation â€” or if I have I do not recollect it. Pray put it in our 
Power to state Facts precisely as far as they regard our State. It is 
agreed on all Sides that a Fault lies some where. I hope the Truth will be 
thoroughly investigated, and to use the homely Proverb, the Saddle laid 
on the right Horse.Â® ....

Dr Sir, 

.... the repeated Instances of British Cruelty exercised upon Amer- 
ican Prisoners particularly those produced in Doctor Franklins Letter to 
Lord Storniont and others this very day by a Master of a Vessel escaped 
from N. York have raised a spirit which will soon appear with the Label 
of Retaliation.^ when the Question is brought I will oppose it in part. 
I abhor the practice of Cruelty and will never in our circumstances con- 
sent to make Returns except in cases where good effects may be expected. 
Circumstanced as we are a general and rigid Retaliation wd be impolitic, 
the common people of England are our Friends. I believe their infamous 
Leaders have strove to extort Cruelty to prisoners on our part in order to 
enrage and unite them against us. nothing less will make them our 
Enemies, to imprison closely and if occasion require to hang a Prescot ^ 
and a Barrington for Injuries done to a Lee will not displease but rather 
be applauded by those common people, such Strokes I have no objection 
to. with the lower Class of Soldiers and Seamen I would contrast Amer- 
ican humanity against British Ferocity, but if a Douglas or a Jordan 
could be handled some Atonement should be made for the Blood of Burke

Philadelphia, August 5, 1777. 

I moved Congress a few days ago, to order Brigadier-General Mcintosh 
from his Station in Georgia to join the grand Army; and it was objected 
to, because it was feared it might derange the Army, or that you would 
have no command for him.^ The cause of my having made this proposi- 
tion was, that he had lately fought a Duel with Governor Gwinnett, in 
which the latter had fallen; and I was afraid the friends of the deceased 
made sore by the loss of their principal, would again blow up the embers 
of party and dissention, and disturb the harmony and vigour of the Civil 
and military authorities. 

I have since received a letter from Georgia, proving that my conjectures 
were too well founded. I therefore take the liberty of requesting to know, 
whether it will be convenient and agreeable to you that he should be 
ordered to join the grand Army.^ 

He is a man of sense and judgment, with a great experience of the 
world; and, in point of bravery, he is fit to fight under the banners of 
General Washington.

Gentlemeji, 

The Congress having ordered generals Schuyler and St. Clair to head- 
quarters that an enquiry may be made into their conduct and the reasons 
of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, they have directed general Gates to take 
the command in that department, and to repair thither with the utmost 
expedition.^ 

In the present critical state of our affairs in that quarter it is absolutely 
necessary, that some vigorous and decisive measures should be taken, to 
stop the progress of the enemy. These steps should be taken as early as 
possible; as the consequences of delay may be extremely disagreeable. 
From the great advantage our enemies have over us in the facility with 
which their troops may be transported by sea to any port of America, they 
will always have it in their power to make a descent before the continental 
army can possibly arrive to oppose them. 

The militia therefore whenever this happens must be depended upon, 
and their exertions, I trust will never be wanting when called on, either to 
defend their own country, or to join with the army of the united states to 
oppose the common enemy, I am therefore most earnestly to entreat you 
will order such part of your militia to reinforce the army under general

number of honest fellows whom we want excecdin^j^ly for better employ- 
ment, disgrace to our Arms and a vast increase to our general debt 
already swelled to an alarming heigth and felt that I should rise a 
criminal if I forbore to say every thing in my power which might tend to 
avert such evils. I delivered my sentiments and was successful, the 
question had scarcely an affirmative. I took occasion to report the value 
and at the same time the precarious and dangerous state to which Georgia 
was reduced, wished if so many Men as had been talked of could be spared 
from this quarter, they might be immediately ordered to that Colony, as 
well for its protection as for laying the foundation of an enterprize nearer 
home which at a proper time might be carried into execution with success 
and which would work half the Conquest of the other place without 
marching a foot towards it. before I sat dowm I moved for a Committee 
to consider the State of Georgia or wished to second the Delegate from 
thence in a motion to that effect, in consequence of these suggestions a 
Committee was appointed whose report favorable to Georgia and I hope 
very agreeable to my friend Mr Clay and yourself you will receive from 
Colonel Walton.^ I think it does not go far enough, if we might have 
raised a certain number of Men for an intended service full of perils and 
almost certain shame and loss, the same number might have been added 
for the security of Georgia worth ten thousand times more, estimating 
property, than the other would have been if w^e had conquered, and for 
conquering a good barrier and removing very dangerous Neighbors. 
these matters are not enjoined in secrecy but the less said upon what we 
had intended or do intend the better, let our Enemies apprehend by our 
Silence, we Sleep. I have been driven too to a necessity of giving my old 
friend Mcintosh a Character in open Congress in opposition to the insinua- 
tions of some of his back friends who I suppose had industriously trans- 
mitted the poison to a few Members, I did not find a difficult task in that 
part, the Labour was pleasant and Gentlemen generally disposed to think 
favorably of him, even those who had " Seen " or perhaps received 
" Letters ", retracted as soon as they were better informed. Colo. Walton 
wnll be more particular.* ....

Dear Sir, 

I have wrote you that 1 1 Colonies in 12 sent Gates ; ^ and the 12th only 
made objection, that he had addressed the Committees of the Grants by 
the same title as they had used in their letters to him â€” miserable objection! 

Jemmy D ' promised me a printed copy of the resolves of Congress 

of the 30th. of June which the New York Delegates got struck ofif but he 
did not perform his promise, though I told him, I wanted it only for you. 
However Town has given them to the world at large to praise or condemn 
as shall seem best.* It was scarcely rub and go by the absence of a Jersey 
member. The expressions are no encouragement to New York though the 
petition of the Grant-men was not allowed. 

Commissary Trumbull has at last got free.^ Arnold too is at liberty 
to quit. He conducted almost without blemish in resigning, if a man 
may be said to do so, who leaves a patriotic exertion because self love was 
injured in a fanciful right incompatible with the general interest of the 
Union.Â® Georgia ^ wrote that he could not expect his claimed rank would 
be restored, as the Eastern States were set against it though he owned he

3 The draft of Aug. 11 has "at Fort Pitt". 

* Besides some differences in phraseology, the draft of Aug. 11 has here the 
additional clause : " Where vast Magazines of Merchandize Warlike Stores and other 
valuables were to be seized the Town and fortifications to be destroyed or reserved 
according to circumstances ". The statement in the close of the paragraph regarding 
the rendezvous at Havana is not found in the earlier draft. 

5 In the earlier draft this passage reads : " an acquisition of necessary articles 
for our Troops and Indian Trade and of other effects ". In the other items of expected 
benefits there are variations of phrase but no essential differences of fact. 

^ At this point the draft of Aug. 11 has the following: 
" I listened with patience to the reasonings on these points till I found the House 
hastening into the measure not because they saw the way but rather because they did 
not and had relied implicitly upon papers sent in by the out of door projectors who ought 
to have been examined pointedly at the Bar of the House, my objections were partly 
to the utility in our present circumstances but principally against the practicability. 

" W' ise men would not rely upon the power of 1000 or 1200 raw Troops to dispossess 
a number not ascertained of disciplined and well armed, nor upon a junction of such 
Troops and Frigates which were not in existance." [The draft ends here A 



August, 7/77 447 

If looo or 1 200 Men should be so suddenly raised they were extremely 
wanted to act against the British Troops in this quarter and move as 
auxiliaries in the Southern States now held by a tenure very little better 
than the will of the Enemy, the power against which they were to act in 
West Florida was confessedly unknown and the junction of Army and 
Frigates admitting these to exist precarious in the highest degree, but 
where were the Frigates? if we had "3 or 4" to spare upon foreign 
exploits they could not be better directed than by order to scour the Coast 
from E, Florida to Cape Fear whence in all probability we should derive 
additional Strength to our Navy and open the passage to Charles Town 
now become the envy of British Cruisers and the emporium of at least one 
half the States. Emigrants from these States had in general abandoned 
us and our Cause in search of Trade, of free Imports and Exports, from 
such men we could expect neither assistance nor secrecy, on the contrary 
they would join with numerous tribes of Indians who had not been 
thought of in the scheme of attack, in order to repel our Troops as the 
most dangerous invaders whose design was to plunder their present Stock 
and to cut off the means of their future Supplies. 

the Governor of Orleans would entertain no high estimation of our 
political forecast should we embark 1200 Men in dependence upon him at 
1000 Miles distance for the very essentials of our expedition before treaty 
or even consultation, and what would be the consequence if we should. 
These facts of success â€” 

If our Frigates found harbour at Havanna we should remember that 
Jamaica afforded safe anchorage to a large squadron of British Ships of 
War and that the vulgar Spaniard for a little Gold would convey intelli- 
gence in a very few hours. 

1000 or 1200 Men just taken from the Mountain Air and Water sent 
in the latter end of October and November to lie in any cove of brackish 
water and near Salt Marshes would sicken and die very fast, even upon 
the fresh River wdiere such Men were exposed to night dews huddled 
together and lived upon Salt food, the list of dead and non effective would 
increase every day. 

It was in vain to hope for Secrecy of an enterprize which had been often 
talked of in different States and long suspected by the Enemy. 

finally that vast expence of Money and Men and further disgrace on our 
Arms would be the result of so mad an enterprize, into which it seemed 
Gentlemen had been hastening merely because they could not see their 
way. 

Your Excellency will not be displeased with the detail of this affair if 
you think the termination without a serious question, a fortunate event 
and that if the Expedition had been attempted and failed as most un- 
doubtedly it would, that our Enemies would have been furnished with 
strong arguments for moving the Creek and other Indians to act offen- 
sively against So Carolina and Georgia. 

from the above circumstances and sorry I am to say, more than a few 
others which I have been w'itness to in Short three Weeks I can hardly 
forbear concluding that a great Assembly is in its dotage and that happily 
for us our Enemy is at the Same time very infirm

A late determination in Cong^ress relative to the rank of a good old Ser- 
vant Gcnl Arnold will probably deprive us of that OlTiccr and may be 
attended by further ill ctlccts in the Army, the reasoning upon this occa- 
sion was disgusting, he was refused not because he was deficient in merit 
or that his demand was not well founded but because he asked for it and 
that granting at such instance would be derogatory to the honour of Con- 
gress, it would be tedious to relate all the particulars but a curious 
anecdote will arise from them.^ Our proceedings have also been injudi- 
cious towards many of the French and other foreign Officers too hastily 
chartered and flooded upon us by Mr. Deane.Â® some of these have ad- 
dressed very riotous Letters to Congress and tis too certain that some of 
them have solid ground for Complaint. I have no doubt but that besides 
disparaging reports of Congress at the Court of France Actions will be 
brought against Mr. Deane for breach of Covenants.Â® he has certainly 
stretched his Commission if not beyond the Letter far beyond all bounds 
of discretion, it seems as if he could not say nay to any frenchman who 
called himself Count or Chevalier 

The Executive Council of Pensylvania by recommendation from Con- 
gress had framed a parole to be signed by the late Officers of King George. 
Governor Penn and Mr. Chief Justice Chew to whom it was tendered 
having in the most indignant terms refused to comply, were taken into 
Custody this morning and Congress have recommended to Send them 
under guard to Virginia to be there held in confinement. It will be no 
misfortune if every other King's Officer and others suspected persons who 
are also included should follow the example of these leaders.^" .... 

I have not the least doubt of the good wishes of all the Trading and 
other people in middle Life that our Independence may be established, 
'tis probable they hold themselves Interested in the event and that many 
thousands already anticipate happiness in a Land of Liberty, the more 
this spirit appears or is even suspected, the more artfully will the move 
ments respecting us be conducted at Versailles. One of our Agents, 
I mean no offence, has not discovered competency to the immense work 
in hand, the other is on the verge of Life and judging from the ordinary 
course of nature must soon drop. I have urged Congress to appoint a 
proper person to repair to France in order to act as a Coadjutor to Doctor 
Franklin while he lives, and in his Stead, in case of Sudden death.^^ a 
precaution like this, a wise man w'ould take where the Interest of a distant 
Rice and Indigo Plantation was concerned and by Heavens Sir we wont

Dear Sir, 

P. S. In reading over my letter I find I have omitted some things, 
which you may be desirous to know : probably you will be informed of 
them by others, but lest you should not, I shall mention such as I think will 
be most interesting; indeed to a person 3000 miles off the most trifling 
circumstances are interesting. We have not yet confederated, but almost 
every member of Congress is anxious for a Confederacy, being sensible, 
that a Confederacy formed on a rational plan will certainly add much 
weight and consequence to the united States collectively and give great 
Security to each individually, and a credit also to our paper money : but 
I despair of such a confederacy, as ought, and would take place, if little 
and partial interests could be laid aside : very few, and immaterial, altera- 
tions will be made in the report of the Committee of the whole house ; this 
is only my opinion, for we have made but very little progress in the house 
in that important affair; immediate and more pressing exigencies having

am informed, it is to be again resumed.^ If this war should be of any 
considerable duration, we shall want men to recruit our armies : could we

not until Oct. 7. See nos. 528, note 2, 537, 556, 558, ante, and nos. 616, 631, 649, 659,

3 Silas Deane wrote to the committee of secret correspondence Nov. 28, 1776 : 
" I have been offered troops from Germany on the following general terms, viz : Officers 
to recruit as for the service of France and embark for St. Domingo from Dunkirk, 
and by altering their route land in the American States. The same has been proposed 
from Switzerland, to which I could give no encouragement, but submit it to your con- 
sideration in Congress whether, if you can establish a credit, as I have before hinted, it 
would not be well to purchase at Leghorn five or six stout frigates which might at once 
transport some companies of Swiss and a quantity of stores, and the whole be defended 
by the Swiss soldiers on their passage? Or, if you prefer Germans, which I really do 
not, the vessels might go from Dunkirk." Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 196. Dec. 3 
he wrote to John Jay: "You may, if you judge proper, have any number of German 
and Swiss troops ; they have been offered me, but you know I have no proposals to treat." 
Ibid., II. 212. Deane's letters are also in Force, Am. Arch., fifth ser.. III. 882, 1051. 
Cf. the Journals, Oct. 18, 1777. William Lee, writing to Charles Thomson, Nov. 24, 
'^777, concerning the enlistment of German troops by Great Britain, declared : " It would 
certainly add to their difficulty and embarrass the British ministry if there were only 
an appearance of beating up for men for the American States in some of the free 
towns in Germany, where all the world by custom is permitted to recruit and enlist men. 
Something of this sort might be attempted, sufficient to give a great alarm and create 
a diversion in your favor at a very little expense, if prudently managed." Wharton, 
Rev. Dipl. Corr., II. 426. The committee of foreign affairs replied, May 14, 1778: 
" The turn of affairs in Europe will make it needless for us to attempt the finesse of 
recruiting in Germany, which you hint at, and which would have a good effect in case 
of necessity." Ihid., 11. 578. 

Antedating Deane's first mention of the matter by more than a year is the suggestion 
of the unknown writer of a letter, Aug. 10, 1775, an extract of which is found in Force, 
Am. Arch., fourth ser.. III. 74. The emphasis of this writer is, however, upon the 
spirit of liberty among the Germans as the basis of recruiting, rather than the merce- 
nary spirit. 

Some items relating to this subject are found among the Franklin Papers in the 
American Philosophical Society and the University of Pennsylvania : a memoir of Dec, 
1776, respecting the hiring of German troops (Univ. of Pa., X. 15, XII. 46) ; proposals 
by Maj. H. E. Lutterloh to raise a corps of troops in Germany for use in America, 
written to Franklin from Paris, Jan. 8, 21, 1777 (Am. Phil. Soc, LX. 50, 51, LXII. 74, 75) ; 
a letter from Chaumont to Franklin, Jan. 27, 1780, concerning the proposal of a German 
prince to furnish a regiment of soldiers for the American service (Univ. of Pa., IV. 
12) ; and a proposal of Jean Guillaume Backhaus to Franklin, written from Hannover, 
Feb. 7, 1783, to recruit a regiment of Germans for service in America, mainly from 
among those who will return from British service (Am. Phil. Soc, XXVII. 90). 
To the latter proposal Franklin replied that he had no authority to set on foot nego- 
tiations to that end, etc. See Hays, Calendar of the Franklin Papers, I. 199, III. 
17, IV. 426, 484. Cf. a letter of Benjamin Rush to Richard Henry Lee, Dec. 20, 1776,

August i8th, 1777. 
My Dear Sir 

I have nothing material to inform you of beyond what the Gacette con- 
tains, except in confidence, that it is a disputed point whether we shall go 
upon the scheme of drawing Bills of Exchange on France to carry interest 
after a certain day if not paid, hoping that bankers and merchants will 
discharge them upon the plighted faith of these States : or whether we 
shall only draw from the interest due on our Loan certificates to be paid 
out of a fund already visible and of most probable increase. Should the 
first plan take place, the mercantile part here would immediately run mad 
after the Bills, and so sink the Loan Office Supply : whereas the certainty 
of dollar for dollar interest would encourage the Loan business, would 
induce the merchant to pay off widow's and orphan's dues to them, 
increase his claim of interest to be paid by Bills of Exchange at the offices 
and w'ould give credit to our tickets in France where they will be bought 
up at par or a trifling discount. In the mean time we may tax very con- 
siderably to lessen the quantity of current paper by burning Colonial. 
Honesty and justice are for the last, fear and cunning are for the first. 
I will give you early intelligence of the decision ; I only add that the last 
is the opinion also of our Commissioners, who have hinted a further plan 
for laying out land in the Mississippi as an object of a Subscription in 
France. This is much more honest than selling Bills without a known 
fund.^ . . .

We are in deep Contemplation upon the state of our Currency. We 
shall promise Payment in the Loan offices of the Interest in Bills of Ex-

.... Congress has on the Table a plan for negotiating a Loan for 
Ten Millions of Dollars if they go no further it may not quite ruin us.^

My Best Friend, 

.... In the northern department they begin to fight. The family of 
Johnson, the black part of it as well as the white are pretty well thinned. 
Rascals ! They deserve extermination. I presume Gates will be so sup- 
ported that Burgoyne will be obliged to retreat. He will stop at Ticonder- 
oga, I suppose, for they can maintain posts although we cannot. I think 
we shall never defend a post until we shoot a general.^ After that we shall 
defend posts, and this event in my opinion is not far off. No other fort 
will ever be evacuated without an inquiry, nor any officer come off without 
a court martial. We must trifle no more. We have suffered too many 
disgraces to pass unexpiated. Every disgrace must be wiped off. 

We have been several days hammering upon money. We are contriv- 
ing every way we can to redress the evils we feel and fear from too great 
a quantity of paper. Taxation as deep as possible is the only radical cure.' 
I hope you will pay every tax that is brought you, if you sell my books, or 
clothes, or oxen, or your cows to pay it.

Philadelphia Augst. iQtli. 1777 
Dear Sir 

I Reed, yours of the 25th. Ulto. (it came to hand after the post was 
g-orn) You say the appointment of GenI Schoyler to the Command at 
the northward gave great uneasiness to New Hampshire and I'l add to 
many other states also and that very justly, the I)eligate[s] from the 
Eastern States told Congress that the people in those States had no confi- 
dence in sd. Genl. but the Influence of said man and the Deligates of New 
York (Dewane and Duer in my opinion is no better then their Genl.) had 
more wait in Congress at that time then all the Deligates from the Eastern 
States and obtained a majority of one vote in his favour, they now see 
the III Consequence of that appointmt and have order'd Genl : Gates to 
supersead him in that Command and sopose he is at that post if well before 
this time Schoyler and St. Clear is ordered to head quarters in order for 
tryeul ^ I hope you'l furnish the Court of Inquiry with all the proofs 
Relating to the situation that post was in and in what manner the troops 
was furnished. Schoyler and St. Clear writes to Congress and says most 
of the troops was old men, Boys, and negros and unfit for garison duty 
their armes very bad and but one bayinet to ten men, that many of the 
officers mutinous and a disgrace to an armey that he (Schoyler) wants 
power from Congress to suspend them," thanks be to praise they are sus- 
pended themselves 

am with much Esteam â€”

2 These remarks of Frost were appended to a copy of a letter from Lincoln to 
Schuyler, dated at Bennington, Aug. 8 (see the postscript to no. 598, ante). Following 
is a part of it : " Yesterday Genl. Stark from New Hampshire came into Camp at 
Manchester, by his Instructions from that State It is at his Option to Act in Conjunc- 
tion with the Continental Armey or not He Seems to be exceedingly Soured and

Affrunt by Congress to him when his Country lays at Stake, at the Same

observe he dont refuse to put him selfe under Genl. Schoyler who is 
Recarled from thet Command and Congress has given the Command of 
thet Armey to Genl. Gates, wch. I Suppose Gel. Starke knew not of at 
that time, as to the promotion of Officers in the Armey the Congress 
went on a new plan agreaed on in Baltimore (at the Raising the as it 
Called Standing Armey) that Every State Should in som measure have 
their propotion of Genl. Officers according to the Troops they Raised by 
which Reason som officers was Supersed [ed] or as they call afronted.^

Dr Sir. 

I enclose you Genl Washington's letter and doubt not you will make a 
proper Enquiry into the Arrest he complains of ^ I wish the Artillery Corp 
and the 16 Regt. had been apportioned on the States that such States 
might have known what were its Quota and the frequent Difficulties in 
filling up those Corps prevented. 

We have no Intelligence of Howe's Fleet: The Army we know for 
a Certainty is embarked. We begin to be apprehensive they have gone to 
South Carolina.^ 

.... Genl Schuyler writes that the Van of Burgoyne's Army he is 
informed has moved forward to Saratoga : I wish our Affairs in that 
quarter bore a more pleasing Aspect : The New England States disgusted 
with Schuyler and his officers have been very slow in giving him Assis- 
tance Gates perhaps will please them and get them to exert themselves.*

impress upon the mind of Congress the value and importance of Georgia 
and to recommend it to their particular protection which your Delegate 
will do me the justice to confirm. I apply in politics, St Paul's remark, 
if one member Suffers all the Members Suffer, the loss of Georgia or 
South Carolina or even their distress will be sensibly felt by all the north-

wish or desire Command, but gave us to understand, his chief motive for 
going into our Service was to be near you, to see Service, and to give him 
an Eclat at home, where he expected he would soon return, these you

his request, and that he could not have obtain'd the Commissn. on any

Since scratching an attendant half Sheet we have had several sorts of 
intelligence that may produce changes very considerable in our domestic 
plans. In the first place there has been a proper council of war and 
determination as things then stood.^ We have in the next place informa- 
tion that on the 15th the Enemy's fleet was at the Capes of Virginia. The 
Genl and Council had thought Sth Carolina or the eastern States the 
Object of Howe's pursuit. I still believe that Virginia is visited thro 
meer necessity, if the present appearance of the ships is any thing more 
than an allarm.Â® .... 

Starks and his militia have made even Genl Chase willing to overlook 
a foolish rashness about rank. The Bennington affair may spur up to 
general vigour in the northern Department.Â® Schyler has been petitioned 
by the Genl Officers to tarry and influence the Militia, and he has 
consented to do it." If he is not a valliant man, he certainly knows 
how to use the w-orld ; he is far from a foolish man. He advises to send 
other indian Commissioners because Mr Woolcot etc. are so far off. I will 
give you the extract. This also is not foolish. 

4 oClock P. M.

Congress shifted frequently between one session a day and two. There were a few more 
trials at double sessions, then, on Oct. i, two sessions were made the rule (see the

Sir, 

Upon the Resignation of Mr. Philips as Commissary of Hydes, the 
Congress have been pleased to appoint Mr. George Ewing in his Place, 
who is ordered to carry into Execution the Plan you have proposed ; ' 
which I make no Doubt he will do with Application and Success

New Hampshire (Meshech Weare).^ 

Philadelphia, August 22d, 1777. 
Sir, 

The inclosed is a copy of General Lincoln's letter to General Schuyler 
and the Resolution of Congress on receiving it, which was the 19th 
Instant.^ Some of the southern Gentlemen made themselves very warm 
on the occasion, threw out many illiberal reflections on General Stark, and 
some on the Legislative authority of the State of New Hampshire, which 
made your delegates sit very uneasy in their chairs even to give them time 
to go through, but in our turn we informed Congress that we had no 
information from the State of New Hampshire to inform us what the 
reasons were that induced them to give such orders to General Stark ; but 
that we had Reed a letter from the Honbl, Josiah Bartlett, a member of 
the Council of that State and lately a member of Congress, which had 
given us some of their reasons, and were such in our opinion as were con- 
clusive, and would justify the conduct of that State in the eyes of the 
whole world : That, in the first place, the Militia of that State had lost 
all confidence in the General Officers who had the command at Tycon- 
deroga when it was evacuated and given up to our enemies; that they 
would not turn out nor be commanded by such officers ; that the preserva- 
tion of the lives of the inhabitants on our frontiers and the cause in which 
we were all engaged made such orders at that critical time absolutely 
necessary ; that we were not about to justify General Stark for making a 
demand of rank in the army at that critical time, but we well knew he had 
a great deal to say for himself on that head, and that he had been in 
almost all the engagements to the northward, and distinguished himself, 
while others were advanced over his head. Yesterday a motion was made 
by Maryland and seconded that a Resolve of Congress might be passed to 
censure his conduct in refusing to submit to the Rules and Regulations of

Aug. 5. A resolution to the effect that Ewing had full authority to carry out Washing- 
ton's plans was presented by the board of war Aug. 19, but the record in the Journals 
would indicate that the resolution was laid on the table, and there is no record of its 
having been taken up again. The letter of Washington alluded to is dated Aug. 16, 
and was read in Congress Aug. 18.

the Army ; on which a larp^e debate ensued, in which we were supported 
by all the New Eng^land Delegates and Some of the Virginians : On 
motion being made, it was agreed it should lie on the table and carried by 
a grate majority.' We inform'd Congress that a motion of that sort came 
with a very bad grace from Maryland who, only, of the thirteen United 
States had seen fit to make laws directly in opposition to Congress by 
refusing that their militia should be subjected to the rules and regulations 
of the army when joynd ; And we informed Congress that we had not 
the least doubt but the first battle they heard of from the North would be 
fought by Stark and the troops commanded by him .... and that I 
should not be afraid to risque my honor nor my life, they would do as 
much towards the defence of that part of the country and the common 
cause, as the same number of any of the troops in that department, 

I will leave you, Sir, to judge of our feelings, when the very next day 
we had a confirmation of what we had asserted by an express from Gen- 
eral Schuyler giving an Account of the victory obtained by General Stark 
and the troops under his command.* We believe this circumstance only 
will make those easy who have been trying to raise a dust in Congress.

Philad 23d Augt. 1777 
My dear General 

I am now to thank you for your kind and confidential favour of the 
[19th] Inst.; ^ with the papers transmitted me by Mr Jay they have and 
shall be seen by those whose good Opinions deserve your Solicitude. 

your Conduct in my Judgement wants no Apology : instead of Censure 
it merits thanks: your Friends in Congress echo this Sentiment freely; 
your Enemies, relentless and bent on your Destruction would willingly 
involve you in the Odium of loosing Ticonderoga. The Change of Com- 
mand was not however founded on this principle but merely on the Repre- 
sentation of the Eastern States that their Militia suspicious of your 
military Character woud not turn out in Defence of New York while you 
presided in the Northern Department. So Confident were they in these 
Assertions and such from your Own representations was the gloomy 
Aspect of our Affairs there, that the Southern Members were alarmed, 
and we thought it prudent not to attempt to Stem the Torrent. It was 
however agreed and declared, as I hinted before, that the Eastern preju- 
dices against you were the only Motive to your recall, and it was under- 
stood that you might take your time in coming down.' Indeed to have 
ordered otherwise, at so critical a Time, wou'd have been inhuman con- 
sidering your family fortune and Influence in that Country, your Reso- 
lution to stay and exert yourself while she remains in such imminent 
danger is worthy of a Virtuous brave and patriotic Citizen : All your 
Friends wish that fortune may put it in your power to give some signal 
Proof of the only military Talent which you have not Evidenced in the 
course of your Command for want of an Opportunity. They all pro- 
nounce that this would put your Enemies to Silence and to Shame and 
elevate you to the highest Rank among the American Commanders.*

in Chesapeak Bay, what may be their intentions Congress is not informed, 
but are prepared, I hope, to disconcert their plan whichever way it may 
be pointed. 

As Congress seem at present inclinable to fortify sea-ports at the Con-

by convincing our Enemies of our Determination to oppose them with 
the utmost Firmness and Resolution.

Philadelphia, August 24th, 1777. 

Honored Sir 

Taking into Consideration that the Enemy have seen proper to 
make this Campaign so far to the Southward and Northward as I am in 
Hopes will give an Opportunity to raise a Sufficient Force of Militia and 
State Battalions to induce Our State joined by Mass and Connecticut to 
make an Attempt upon Rhode-Island : And in Order to give a Spring to 
such a hoped for Design; and wishing at least to get our Shipping and 
Continental Navy out to Sea, I ventured to draw up the enclosed Resolu- 
tions and prefer them to Congress : They were by Congress referred to 
the Marine Committee, and obtaining a favorable Report from that Board, 
I finally got them passed by Congress nearly as I had at first drawn them 
up.^ If they should be thought by the Navy Board for the Eastern De- 
partment, and the Councill of War of Our own State, to have been idle, 
inexpedient or unadvisable, I shall but have lost my Pains, not doubting 
but they will be candidly considered. If, on the other Hand, they should 
meet the Approbation of the State I have the Honor to represent, I shall 
feel myself amply rewarded : And should they prove efficatious in deliver- 
ing Our Trade and Commerce and the Continental Navy from its present 
Embarassments my every Wish will be unspeakably gratified. I thought 
I could not well answer it to the distressed State of Rhode Island to 
remain an Idle Spectator of the Calamities to which it has been reduced 
without receiving any Continental Aid, while so many Thousands have 
been expended in the particular Defence of Delaware Bay and River ; 
not less than ten Fire Ships, besides several large Gallies having been 
ordered by Congress, exclusive of very great Continental Assistance in 
constructing and raising of Batteries etc.^ I would by no means however 
wish to see the publick Monies expended in our State, without a hopeful 
Prospect of its being really beneficial. And I would therefore strongly 
recommend that it be first well considered. I doubt not you will have the 
same Resolves inclosed to you by the President ; but I have hitherto made 
it my Duty to transmit you all Resolves that respect Our State

It is with the utmost Regret the Congress hear, that Genl. Stark has 
Instructions to act independant of the Army of the United States, if he 
should be so inchned. As Nothing can be more destructive of mihtary 
Subordination, or produce greater Confusion in the Service, than the 
Existence of any Corps or Body of Men, free from the Controul of the 
Commander in Chief, and the Rules of Discipline that bind the Rest of 
the Army, it is the earnest Desire of Congress that Genl. Stark may be 
subject to the same Regulations by v^hich all other general Officers of the 
Militia have been hitherto governed when called out at the Expence of the 
United States. I am therefore to request you will give Genl. Stark 
Instructions to govern himself accordingly. 

I beg leave to refer your Attention to the enclosed Resolve and to 
intreat your immediate Compliance with it, as the only effectual Means 
of preventing Discord, and restoring that Harmony so indispensably 
necessary at this Juncture in the Army of the United States of America.^

Dear Sir, 

.... The Confederation goes on but slowly, occasioned by the immen- 
sity of business created by the war. But I find our right to our Charter 
bounds, as stated by our Act of Government will be strongly contested. 
The Charter of 1609 it is said has been vacated, and that no transfer of 
that Charter right can be shewn from the Company to the people of 
Virginia. That therefore the ungranted lands were the property of the 
Crown, and being taken from it, by Common exertions, must become 
common Stock. Will you be so kind as favor me with your reasons and 
authorities in support of our right? ' . . . .

appointed Aug. i to report the mode of conducting the inquiry into the evacuation of 
Ticonderoga, and drew the report which was the basis of the resolutions of Aug. 27. 
He was also chairman of the committee appointed Aug. 28 to collect the evidence and 
facts relative to the evacuation. He has here set down in order, but more minutely 
subdivided, the points of inquiry found in the report of Aug. 27, followed by memoranda 
of agreements in the proceedings of the committee of Aug. 28 as to certain lines of 
inquiry. The fact that Richard Henry Lee was a member of this committee will explain 
why this document is found among the Lee Papers. The other member of the com- 
mittee was John Adams. Laurens has given to these heads of inquiry the date Aug. 27, 
the date on which the mode of inquiry was determined, but the minutes of committee 
proceedings evidently belong to some subsequent day, as the committee was not appointed 
until Aug. 28. Dec. 26, 1777, three members were added to the committee, namely, 
Francis Dana, John Witherspoon, and William Ellery. Jan. 20, 1778, James Lovell was 
put in place of Dana. Jan. 27 James Smith was added to the committee. Feb. 5 the 
committee reported that it had collected the evidence, and was ordered to transmit it 
to General Washington, who was directed to order a court-martial. Apr. 29 a committee 
was appointed to examine the evidence and state the charges against the general officers 
who were in the Northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were 
evacuated. This committee reported June 12.

Dear Sir 

.... Congress is now engaged in ways and means for filling an 
almost exhausted Treasury without repeating an Emission of paper 
Dollars the favorite Scheme is that of borrowing from France, which 
I esteem [the most] destructive step we can take, so far as for all internal 
demands, and will be to all intents and purposes a further emission of 
paper Money infinitely more detrimental in its consequences than the 
evil which is dreaded from a further Issue of Dollars, it may deprive us 
too of the use of so much Money as we shall want in France for the most 
important occasions to which paper Dollars are inadequate. I have 
endeavoured to point out ways and means by which our Treasury might 
be filled without either of the modes above mentioned, make the Condi- 
tions of your Loan more favorable I might say more equitable to Lenders, 
and practice that frugality and oeconomy in public and private affairs 
which was our boast in 1774 and from which particularly in public 
Oeconomy we have departed as widely as prodigality lies from discretion

Dear Sir, 

.... The Congress has chosen a Committee to collect what evidence 
they can for the trial of officers at Ticonderoga, as you'll see more at large

in that collection.^ 

There has been lately a discovery as is supposed a plot by the Quakers 
in this place against the States, by furnishing our Enemies with intelli- 
gence etc. (I fear we shall fail of that proof that is expected) which has 
in some degree laid the censure on all those people in the United States ; 
and the Congress has passed some Resolves to be sent to the United States 
in order to apprehend some of those people. I trust our Court will act 
with their own prudence and caution in that affair.^ 

The Treasury board has not made any report on our request for money, 
but are daily promising to do it ; am still in doubt whether we shall suc-

ceed, as the Congress is in want of all our money for the public use : * 
It is greatly wished by Congress that the monied men would supply the 
loan office faster, and that all the States would go largely into taxation. 

There is no Commissioners appointed as yet in the Eastern Department 
to settle the accts. of those States, except what is relating to the army, but 
suppose there will be some appointed soon;" as we have requested of 
Congress to appoint such to examine the State of New Hampshire's acct, 
it would be no small advantage to your Delegates if we could be honor'd 
with the Acts or Resolves of our Honorbl. Court, so far as relates with our 
duty we oicc the State and Court in Congress ; we were left to guess the 
Reasons the State had in giving Genl Stark his orders as it is said he had, 
and trust we have given the Congress sufficient reason to justify the State 
therein, and to prevent any censure on the State in supposing they had any 
desire in acting in a separate or distinct line, but in conjunction and steady 
union with the whole United States and for the general welfare of the 
same ;"....

Dr Sir: 

The inclosed paper will give you all the public intelligence since my 
last. The complexion of affairs is not yet become so determined that I 
can set off for home ; but I am in daily expectations of some events which 
may determine my resolutions to that purpose. Our finances have long 
engaged our attention in Congress, but we have not yet come to any con- 
clusive Resolutions thereon. The subject is of the greatest importance, 
and truly too great for our talents. One thing every one seems clear in, 
that Taxation in a ver}^ liberal degree must take place. This, Sir, is so 
necessary that it must at all events be attempted every where. The 
quantity of money in circulation, and its consequent depreciation, and the 
accumulating debt of the public makes it inevitably necessary. I fear the 
system under consideration will not be so far matured before my depar- 
ture that I can carry it with me, or know how to apply my endeavours at 
home towards the perfection of it, I shall however make myself as much 
master as possible of the prevailing opinions thereon.^ You will find by 
the intelligence that our affairs every where bear a promising aspect, I

Dear Sir, 

.... Congress is not the respectable body which I expected to have 
found, to be particular on this point would be improper, but I mention 
so much from that feeling which is irrisistible. I see my own private 
affairs going to Wreck. I am helping forward the heavy loss by most 
amazing expences here. I am adding to the load of trouble which my 
friends must have from attending to their own concerns, and am render- 
ing my Country no intrinsic services, this latter consideration grieves 
me most. I think I have been instrumental in averting two pernicious 
schemes and except these my time 8 or 10 hours every day has been 
squandered, the most necessary work we have to do at present is that of 
Confederating, and that of making a state of past expences, to be fully 
informed of the application of those Millions already Issued to govern our 
future proceedings by wiser measures and to fill our exhausted Treasury 
by means least likely to involve us in difficulties, my attempts to accom- 
plish these great purposes have hitherto proved fruitless and I have too 
much reason to fear, from a discovery of the cause, will ever prove so, un- 
less very particular Instructions from some of the States should be charged 
upon their Delegates to demand of Congress an adjustment of accounts.^ 
I wish we were half an hour together I would say many things to you. 
as an Assembly Man, in favour of our little honest State, what I have 
said you may think of in that Character but as being said to your self 
only

cause of our Enemies, who have peremptorily refused to take an Oath or 
affirmation of Allegiance to the state or to give a parole to the Executive 
power, should have a hearing in their own defence, the hearing which 
they aim at is not intended, but a hearing they may have, if they will 
accept the mode prescribed. Congress have recommended to the Execu- 
tive Council to hear what they have to allege " for removing Suspicion 
that they are Enemies to the Independence of the United States." * 

I am much mistaken if by this shifting ground the Cry of persecution 
will not be raised ten times higher, and that Congress and Council will 
eventually make rediculous figures 

when I first arrived here I was told by way of caution that in Congress 
there were parties. I soon perceived there were, in the short space of 
Seven Weeks I have discovered parties within parties, divisions and Sub- 
divisions to as great a possible extent as the number 35 (for we have never 
more together) will admit of as it is wholly contrary to my genius and 
practice to hold with any of them as party, so I incur the censure of not 
being long with any 

I told you I had been Instrumental in averting two pernicious schemes, 
this is one of the Instances * â€” the other was a proposed mad expedition. Â° 
but I have not succeeded to my wish, far from it. by a Majority of one 
voice we have Resolved to draw on France at all hazard, Tobacco or no 
Tobacco, or whether the fund may be exhausted by other demands or not, 
to draw I say for the amount of Interest of all past and future loans.' 

I cannot persuade Gentlemen to believe that Bills of Exchange on 
France bearing 6 Per Cent Interest is a further emission of paper Money, 
but so much more dangerous than an emission of Square Dollars by the 
Interest which will accumulate to be repaid abroad and thereby in effect 
mortgaging to a foreign Crafty power so much of our Soil. I cannot 
prevail upon them to believe that if their Loan Certificates were made 
payable in one Year instead of three or five Years and the Interest quar- 
terly or half Yearly, Money holders could be induced to lend more freely. 
I cannot prevail by my reasoning, to prove that either from the tenour 
of their present loan Certificates or from the insufficiency of the Sums 
Emitted to answer the amazing circulation of paper Currency and also for 
a return into the public Funds, arises the slackness and deficiency of 
Loans. I believe it arises chiefly from the former, because there can be no

II. 283. Cf. nos. 591, 594-597, 618, 620, anie. He closes his observations with these 
remarks: "Is this going hand over head? is it governing 13 United States by random 
Strokes of policy? or did it spring from sinister motives? I cannot suspect the latter 
yet such projects were the megrims of men who hold themselves of the first rank and 
first importance in our political system."

Man so stupid, as to think Congress Money in many Rills more perma- 
nent and secure by lying in their Desks useless and subject to many 
ordinary risques than it would be if it was comprised and expressed in 
one CertiHeate of Congress Money and bearing 6 Per Cent Interest â™¦ â™¦

20 Millions of Expence per Annum all i)aid in ready Money whether the 
Kxpcnce be fÂ«>r Soldiers Waggons and Rations or for Broad Cloth and

8 or 10 Millions Per Annum, of which Jth. at least [is] entered into Books 
not paid for in twelve or 18 months and even the not \(\ paid for in Paper 
Money but in produce of the Ground, nor can I persuade Such Men to 
own, although they must know, that however hard they may Struggle 
and rant in order to accomplish impossibilities the Value of their paper 
Currency whether in Bills of Exchange hawked about in France or in 
Paper Dollars contemned in Philadelphia Beef-Market will continue to 
decrease until we can open our Ports and obtain a free exchange for the 
products of our Land, we may indeed find some temporary relief by Sale 
of Forfeitures within, what is worse than all I cannot prevail upon them 
to listen to the alarm â€” that going into debt to France howbeit this may 
afford us present means and put our debt out of sight for a little while 
will be mortgaging our Soil will induce that Court to persevere in her 
plan " to do no act which may seem to acknozuledge our Independency," 
will encourage the British Ministry to protract the War, will infallilDly 
Create Jealousies and engender broils and divisions among the States 
and will in a very few years burst our Childish bubble of Independence â€” 
that from these aw^ful considerations Wisdom dictates to us to draw upon 
France for no more Money than is absolutely necessary to purchase and 
pay for articles essential to our defensive War â€” that we should contract 
our expences public and private â€” recommend Taxation in each Colony â€” 
borrow at home upon the best terms â€” clear the States of Enemies â€” 
Sell vacant and forfeited Tracts and other Estates â€” encourage Manufac- 
tures â€” Strive more ardently to improve our marine force and do a 
Thousand other things which we know to be necessary which we ought 
immediately to engage in and which we would do, if Luxury and Avarice 
were discountenanced and banished If we have not virtue enough to 
Save our Selves, easy access to the Treasury of France will only hasten 
our ruin, these Sir are ver\' Serious considerations I have suffered much 
distress of mind on the occasion. I have been told that my arguments 
were very pretty for theoretic writers, but I appeal to experience, it is 
from experience I draw my reasoning. I do not contend for a further 
Emission of paper Money, I w^ish to avoid it. I am sure we may avoid 
it if we please. I contend against the most dangerous of all Emissions 
drawing Bills on a foreign Court, but if we must emit for domestic pur- 
chases and services, of two Evils I would choose the least, many other 
arguments I have at different Stages introduced, too many to trouble 
you with.^ ....

September, i/// 479 

It is now Monday Morning the 8th 

I will trouble you a little further on the Subject which I droped the (5th. â€” 
* * * * [jic] 

It was said, " many people held Congress Money to purchase Lands and 
other bargains or would even lend it at a low Interest to private persons in 
preference to putting it into the Loan Office." answer, admit these to be 
facts, what is proved but that there is a circulation for Money either by 
purchases or by Loans, and that there are some people who have so good 
an opinion of Congress Money as to Exchange Land for it, and some 
who have opportunities of improving it in different ways otherwise they 
would not borrow; and the loans to them being at a low Interest prove 
these to be men of Substance. 

Again, " Many people will not take Congress Money who will by some 
means or other find Money to purchase Bills and fill your Loan Office." 
granted ; but who are these people ? Surely our friends do not refuse to 
take Congress Money? and shall we Involve the States in a debt which 
may involve their ruin in order to accomodate our Enemies'? but is it 
certain that Tories who will not Credit us here at home, where there is 
a Stamina, will take our paper Money Payable in a Country where we 
have wo foundation ? 

" But it has been the practice of all Nations to borrow " ; true when 
necessity obliged them, and so far and no further. I consent now to 
borrow, but so extremely cautious wise nations have been of borrowing 
from other powers, so jealous even of a Balance of Trade against them 
has Great Britain been, that they broke off connexion with France and 
submitted to drink muddy port instead of Sparkling Champaign and 
brilliant Claret. 

" But Great Britain owes now about 40 Million to the States of Holland 
for Money borrowed." this lies on you to prove, but I believe I may 
safely deny it. the Dutch Subjects I will grant have money in the British 
Loans. I dont know to what amount perhaps six or eight Millions, so 
have the subjects of other States as Individuals. But if Nations have 
been accustomed to borrow of other Nations have they not given Security ? 
did not Holland put some of her Port Towns into the hands of the Queen 
of England ! did not Prussia Mortgage Selissia for the Credit established 
in London? which of the United States will you put into the hands of 
France as guarantee for the Sums intended to be borrowed, but why will 
you borrow when by a reassumption of that Virtue which we boasted of 
and dropped in the Same Year, you may go on and Succeed without 
borrowing ? 

" But France asks us no Guarantee, she offers to lend without any 
Security and when we are in her debt it will be her Interest to Support 
us." true she has as yet Courted us to take trifling Sums and magnified 

" the K s Â® generosity " in demanding no Security. She has also told 

us it is impossible to let us have the trifling Sum of two Millions Sterling, 
how long shall we remain free from a demand for guarantee? can any 

8 " King's."

one answer? If it will he consistent with the interest of France to Sup- 
port us when we are in her debt, it will be equally consistent with her 
Interest and her practise too to send a few Men of War, Troops and 
Officers into one or more of our ports to protect us from insults from our 
old Enemies and at the Same time to collect the Revennues due for the 
Loans, we have a recent proof of the Value France has put upon our 
Lands in our present Circumstances. " Livre or io\d. Sterling per Acre." 
what folly what madness it will be to involve our selves in debt to that 
power, we should at least refrain until we have Resolved upon the Port 
for the reception of the French Men of War. 

I compare our present attempt to the folly of a Young Man borrowing 
Money from a designing Sharper upon the Credit of an expected Heir- 
ship. We are unwary and love ease and pleasure, we will borrow because 
it will save trouble. France pleads poverty in order to enhance the favor, 
will lend as much as she can (if you will enable her) and asks no Security, 
this magnifies the Royal and National Generosity, to whom are these 
manifique Offers proposed? to free and independent States? No â€” to 
puppets whom she keeps behind the Curtain, to Squeak her purposes, for 
tis her plan " to do no Act which shall seem to acknowledge our Inde- 
pency." [,sic'] She will not openly receive our Agents, her minister 
tells them â€” " it will be well taken if they communicate with no other 
persons about the Court but himself, that he will at all convenient seasons 
be ready to confer with them." they treat our Agents " with all Civility 
but are cautious of giving Umbrage to England." 

" they (the french ministry) take every step to gratify England pub- 
lickly â€” attend to their Remonstrances, forbid Ships with Military Stores 
for America to depart, recal leave of absence to their Officers going out to 
America and in presence of the British Minister give Strict Orders that 
American Prizes should not be sold in France, at the same time all these 
things are nevertheless done and they assure us (American Agents) of

dissimulation and American Puppetism? 

Would wise men, would the Guardians of thirteen Orphan States in- 
cautiously trust their W^ards in the power of such a Court? if you pro- 
fusely borrow from her you will, you must be in her power. I tremble 
at the prospect. I would almost rather return to subjection to England, 
but I would surely rather recall our Agents than submit any longer to such 
Insults. France will not for her own Interest let you go back to England, 
be Virtuous, she will also for her own Interest seek you, she will continue 
to supply you with everything needful and to keep her ports open to your 
ships, in a little time such virtuous Resolutions will render you Indepen- 
dent of both France and England. I must have tired you good Sir and 
yet I have not minuted here one half that I thought my self obliged to 
say and repeat upon this important business in the Course of 5 or 6 days 
debate and adjournment, many good men see into the danger of con-

tracting a debt with France but they dont see clearly, they say " what shall 
we do the Treasury is Empty." this shews our Error in having neglected 
so long, a business which is one of the main pillars of our Independence, 
it shews our folly too in the wanton terms proposed for Treaty last year.^Â° 
there the Court of Versailles has again made puppets of us and treated us 
with the Contempt we deserved. God Grant Mr. Washington, that brave 
and virtuous that disinterested Patriot. Hero, success in a conflict which is 
probably now in agitation and we shall have further time to retrospect our 
proceedings and to mend what shall appear to have been amiss, if he fails, 
a New Scene will open. Nothing but Virtue then can save us. we never 
shall call in her aid until we feel severe distress, tis time to attend Con- 
gress, may be when I return I may tell you more of the Quaker affair 
and trouble you with another sheet, but before I go let me suggest a 
danger which we seem to be drawn into, a whole week is passed and 
nothing is said or done further for replenishing our Treasury, if the 
proper means are neglected until that is nearly or more nearly exhausted, 
we may be frighted into a measure big with ruin, that of drawing for five 
or ten Million Dollars for doing which we have neither permission nor 
encouragement, if this shall happen remember I have foretold it and to 
you and others of my Constituents who are concerned in the event. 

I am happy in having Mr. Middleton exactly coincide in sentiments with 
me altho he has not spoke to the point. Mr. H." differs but I would not 
have it taken notice of for w^hatever his opinions may be, he is a man of 
Candor and Integrity, and I wish not to name any Body. 

pth Septemr. â€” I did not return from business yesterday till the Sun 
had Set, eat a Scanty dinner and was obliged to go out again upon business 
when I came home I felt a much stronger propensity for the Bed than the 
writing Table, it was mortifying to sit from 1 1 oClock to ^ past 6 with- 
out respite. Spend four hours of that time wrangling a point which I 
think had employed us five days before, receive and pocket a well timed 
and spirited reprimand from the Council and end the business relative to 
the Quakers and other self disaffected, where it might have been ended 
and in the manner in which it ought to have been ended in five minutes 
from the very outset, by recommending to confine at an appointed place, 
Stanton in Virginia, all the mischeivous and active ones, who shall refuse 
to take the Oath or affirmation of Allegience to the State. I will not say 
the business is quite ended, for as the Council feel or rather express them- 
selves as if they were chaffed by our conduct, it may be, they will have 
nothing further to do in it.^^

15 These remarks of Laurens seem to apply to the proceedings of Sept. 9, but the

.... As to Journals â€” be persuaded that no Expence or Industry has

The Flight of Printers and the Want of Paper has impeded the Work 
till now, when we have a good Prospect. We are up to Octr. 25th. and 
shall very shortly have the Year â€” 76 in a Volumn. 

When the main Army is at our Elbow, and while we are Situated in

As to losing the Confidence of the People, I shall be sorry for their own 
Sakes ; But, by way of Scare Crow to an honest Heart. I value it as little 
as any other natural Phenomenon of Nature. There is a majority in 
every State of the Union, and in every great Assembly, w'hich can be 
depended upon, at this Day ; But there are also heavy Clogs in each. The 
Cause of the People is safe. But their Patients must have full Exercise. 
Virtuous themselves they cannot be ruined by their present Assailants.

have been obliged to have pointed out Individuals of this State for Arrest.

army is on its way here, with professed design to give this city up to the 
pillage of the soldiery. They have taken infinite pains, according to 
custom, to move lieaven and earth in their favor, and have transmitted 
copies of their indecent remonstrances over the country. Congress have, 
to prevent ill impressions, ordered their several inimical testimonies to be 
published in one Hand-bill." Altho' nothing can be more certain than 
that allegiance and protection are reciprocal duties, yet these men have 
the assurance to call for the protection of those laws and that Government 
which they expressly disclaim, and refuse to give any evidence of their 
allegience to. There is no doubt but that they will endeavor by means 
of the " Friends " in Virginia, to make disturbance and raise discontent 

there, but this may serve to put you on your guard This day 

Congress has proposed that the Quaker Tories should be sent forthwith 
to Staunton in Augusta. I hope you will have them well secured there, 
for they are mischievous people. Should Howe be disappointed here, 
as it seems very likely that he will, it is more than probable that he will

Dear Sir, 

I had the honour of writing to Your Excellency the 12 and 15 August 
by Colo. Sumpter.* A very important question varied in different 
branches of borrowing Money from the Court of France has been since 
agitated in Congress. I have been uniformly against the measure and 
think it my duty by the earliest opportunity to inform Your Excellency 
the grounds of my dissent.' 

The first question was for drawing Bills on our Commissioners for 
Ten Millions Dollars, which passed in the Negative. 

A proposition was then made and a question put for drawing for five 
Millions of Dollars, passed also in the negative. 

Yesterday by the most extraordinary motion and irregular proceeding 
that I have ever been Witness to in any other Assembly a Question was 
carried for drawing Bills of Exchange on our Commissioners at the rate 
of 5 Livres of France for a Spanish Dollar for payment of Interest at 
6 per Cent per Annum of all Money already brought into the loan office 
or that shall be brought in before the ist. March next. 

It is expected that upon this encouragement money holders will bring 
Supplies to the Loan Office and that we may without another Emission 
of paper raise before the ist. March 20 M[illion] Dollars, the Annual 
Interest of which will be about Â£270000 Sterling besides the risques of loss 
and delay by Remittances.

' Tis true the Commissions have given Congress assurance of Money 
received and promised, sufficient to pay the Interest of five Million 
Dollars annually and added " we hope " also to find sufficient by subsidies 
to pay the Interest of 20 Million if we should be obliged to borrow that 
sum. at the same time they informed us, that upon application to the 
Court of France to borrow two Million Sterling they were told it was 
" impossible " to spare such a sum. that they had been strongly pressed 
and that the Minister was " anxious " to contract for the delivery of 
20,000 Hogsds of Tobacco as a ground for raising Money by Taxes. 
That they had actually engaged to deliver 4000 Hogsds and had received 
a very considerable advance on the Stipulation and " earnestly intreat " 
Congress to enable them to comply with their part of the agreement, 
which while our ports are stopped will be impossible.* 

It appears to me that the foundation for drawing Bills is not substan- 
tial, the practice dangerous and the measure except for articles absolutely 
requisite for carrying on our defensive War not necessary. 

the Commissioners Speak possitively of Money advanced and expected 
by periodical payments only for payment of the Interest of five Millions,' 
which sum and a much larger I apprehend will be consumed by a variety 
of other demands on them, which 'tis impossible from our mode of trans- 
acting business and our total ignorance of the public debt contracted and 
increasing, to form an Estimate of. this forbids in the strongest terms 
the Act of borrowing Money abroad, they say in a subsequent dispatch " 
that we may rely on punctual payment of Congress â€” Bills drawn for the 
discharge of the Interest of Sums borrowed, but refer I apprehend only 
to the Five Million per Annum and here they recommend that the Interest 
should be reduced to 3 or 4 per Cent, but Congress upon a question con- 
firmed 6 per Cent against 5, and have put former loans upon a level with 
such as may be here after made.^ 

the Court of France on failure on our part of the Contract for Tobacco, 
our continued demands on them for Money, for ship building Cloths 
Arms and many other articles will have ground for Complaint and may 
make a pretext of failure on our side witholding further payments to the 
Commissioners. 

the drawing Bills of Exchange is to all intents and purposes emissions 
of Paper Money upon the very worst terms aggravated by 6 per Cent 
per Annum to be discharged under all disadvantages in a foreign country, 
it is putting our debt out of Sight for a little but it will infallibly return 
upon us with accumulated force. 

Although France has premptorily told us it is impossible to lend us 
two Million Sterling we are hastening to make a demand for that and 
for aught we know a much larger sum.

the Seeming: temporary relief whicli we shall receive by draughts upon 
France will draw otT our attention from enquiring deeply into the State 
of our funds and debts and help us in our present alarming course of 
extravagance. 

We shcHild pay proper regard to the conduct of the Court of Versailles, 
in refusing to receive our Commissioners openly in their Ambassadorial 
Characters, in " avoiding every act which should seem to acknowledge 
our Independence." in '* refusing possitively " the Naval Aid which we 
had applied for, in neglecting to consider or give any answer to our plan 
for a Treaty and in betraying part of our proposals and possibly the whole 
of them to the British Ambassador, in a taunting Sarcastical remark to 
one of our Commissioners that we had not bid high enough,^ in Imprison- 
ing one of our Captains, Seizing his Vessel, ordering a restitution of his 
prizes and in a word carefully avoiding to give " Umbrage " to the 
English." 

To borrow Money from a foreign power is to mortage our Soil, that 
the boasted generosity of the K of F." in funding us lightly and demand- 
ing no security is. when compared with the conduct above mentioned 
liable to Suspicion of being insidious. It \\\\\ be the Interest of the 
French Minister to ensnare us by degrees into a considerable debt and the 
knowledge of the Negotiation will be a strong incentive to the British 
for protracting the War. 

that " by altering the tenor of our Loan Certificates making the pay- 
ment of Capital at one instead of three Years and of Interest quarterly 
or half Yearly, Money holders would be induced to bring supplies into 
the Office, that the expectation which the public have been held in of an 
emission of Bills of Exchange for 5 or 10 M[illion] of Dollars had been 
no small impediment. 

When the loan Office Certificates are put on a beneficial plan, if Money 
shall not be brought, in sums equal to the public exigency, it will be a 
proof that past emissions are not excessive, the demand for money at 
this time is not confined to the Capital Towns and Cities and within a 
small Circle of Trading Merchants, but spread over a surface of 1600 
miles in length and three hundred broad nor is it nov.^ the practice to give

credit for one and more years for |th. of the whole traffic, every Man 
IS now a Money holder and every article is paid for in Cash, it is 
hence obvious that an immense sum is necessary for a compleat circula- 
tion. No Man would be so void of understanding- as to keep Continental 
Bills Idle and at a risque of loss in his desk when he might upon the 
Same Security improve them at 6 per Ct. per Annum. 

The sudden rise of price for domestic necessaries of Life is not wholly 
owing to great Emissions of paper, but in fact principally to the total 
Stoppage of Imports and the consequent scarceness and dearness of such 
articles as our real wants cannot, and too many which our Luxury will 
not forego. 

Borrowing of a foreign power will not increase the value of our paper 
Money, it may and probably will be the source of extending the depre- 
ciation to Several Years beyond the term when we might if we were in 
debt at home only, have redeem'd it." 

Such and many other arguments I used upon this occasion particularly 
recommending Taxation and the most vigorous exertions for opening our 
Ports and promoting exportation. I had the mortification to fail in my 
endeavour, the question being put and the Yeas and Nays demanded 
there appeared 21 Yeas and 5 Colo. Harrison Mr. Jno.' Adams Mr. 
Duane Mr. Middleton Mr. Laurens Nays. If I have erred in my attempts 
it is fortunate for my Country that I have done no harm, but the measure 
appears to me big with danger, and as I am apprehensive a further 
attempt may be made to draw for some Capital Sum on the Commis- 
sioners I request to be instructed by Your Excellency whether to consent 
or protest. 

I beg your Excellency's pardon for having delivered my self on this 
important subject so unconnectedly, but I am reduced to a very short space 
for writing, my Colleagues had intended to have sent our dispatches on 
tomorrow by an express messenger we have now determined to stay 
him til we learn the event of an approaching general battle between our 
Army and the British now very near each other and within thirty miles 
of this City.^^ I intend this by the hands of Doctor Houston who waits 
for it. I shall inclose half a dozen news papers and refer to them for past 
intelligence and add only that I am with great regard and esteem etc. 

P. S. Casting my Eye upon the Resolve I perceive the time for bring- 
ing money into the Loan office in the terms above mentioned stands 
unlimited, the Report of a Committee of the whole House had Limited 
1st. March which was passed over without a question so very irregularly

4 O'clock A. M. 
Sir, 

I am this Moment favoured with yours by the Express.'' I am sorry 
for the unfortunate Issue of the Day, but from the Troops keeping up 
their Spirits, I flatter myself it will still be in our Power to retrieve the 
Loss of Yesterday. 

I have thought, proper, in Consequence of the Intelligence received 
this Morning, to call the Congress together at Six O'Clock. 

1* Laurens's conclusion that the limiting date, March I, 1777, had been left out 
of the resolution as finally passed, is erroneous. A motion for the payment, by bills of 
exchange, of the interest on future issues of loan certificates without any time limit was 
adopted Sept. 9 (see also the motion Sept. 10), but the final action, Sept. 10, was the 
adoption of the resolution as reported, Sept. 9. by the committee of the whole. See 
the Journals, pp. 724, 725, 730, 731. It is needful to observe however that (as indicated 
in the Library of Congress edition of the Journals, pp. 730-73 1"* the adoption of the 
report as a whole is not recorded in the original Journals, but only in the " corrected " 
Journals (see the Prefatory Note in the Journals, vol. II., p. 7). It seems probable that 
in the division of the question the limiting date was inadvertently left out of the proposition 
voted upon Sept. 9, and that this feature of the measure was restored by a later vote 
upon the resolution as reported by the committee of the whole. A comparison of the 
Library of Congress edition of the Journals with the older editions (that is, the " original " 
with the "corrected" Journals) shows two other differences that require to be pointed 
out : In the former the report of the committee of the whole is quoted entire, and there 
is no motion to divide ; whereas in the latter the record reads : 

" Congress took into consideration the resolution reported from the committee of the 
whole; \\'hereupon, it was moved that it be divided, and the sense of Congress taken 
on it, reduced to distinct propositions ; it was then moved ", etc 

15 Following the adoption of the resolution it was ordered : " That the resolution 
now agreed to be published." Oct. 6, an order was passed requesting the states to 
publish the resolution in their respective gazettes for six months successively.

My Dearest Friend, 

You will learn, from the newspapers, before this reaches you, the situa- 
tion of things here. Mr. Howe's army is at Chester, about fifteen miles 
from this town. General Washington's is over the Schuylkill, awaiting 
the flank of Mr. Howe's army. How much longer Congress will stay 
is uncertain. I hope we shall not move until the last necessity, that is, 
until it shall be rendered certain that Mr. Howe will get the city. If we 
.should move, it will be to Reading. Lancaster, York, Easton, or Beth- 
lehem, some town in this State. It is the determination not to leave this 
State.^ Don't be anxious about me, nor about our great and sacred cause. 
It is the cause of truth and will prevail. If Howe gets the city, it will cost 
him all his force to keep it. and so he can get nothing else 

643. Henry Laurens to George Galphin.^ 

i6th. Septem. 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

Although from Circumstances of our affairs 'tis impossible for me to 
reply so fully as I would otherwise have done to your favour received by 
the hands of the Reverend Mr. Holmes yet a total silence would be 
inexcusable. 

I congratulate w ith your success in treating v/ith the Creek Indians. 
I hold the States of SÂ° Carolina and Georgia as well as all the United 
States much indebted to your unwearied labours for the present good 
disposition of those Savages and as their continuance in this temper 
depends much upon your exertions so we are all bound to pray for your 
life and health.^ 

3 If this was the result of action on the part of Congress the resolution is not 
found in the Journals. Maryland had preferred a request, Aug. 28 (see the Journals, 
p. 692), for "a skilful engineer and an experienced artillerist". Congress referred the 
matter to Washington, who replied Aug. 29 (read in Congress Aug. 30), that he could 
not spare the officers at that time. This was reported to Governor Johnson by Chase, 
in a letter of Aug. 30 (N. Y. Pub. Library, Emmet Collection, no. 1619). Probably Le 
Brun and Pierre were sent by Washington in accordance with the request of Aug. 28.

Galphin was an Indian trader, whose residence, " Silver Bluff ", was on the South

growing out of the treat>' of Augusta, 1773. with the Creeks and Cherokees, was prose- 
cuted by his family against the state of Georgia, against the British government, and 
finally against the United States. The claim was allowed by the United States in 1848. 
The Galphin claim came into passing political notoriety because of the fact that it

it, Congress have requested if the Fact be true that one of your State

18. Thursday. The violent north-east storm, which began the day 
before yesterday, continues. We are yet in Philadelphia, that mass of 
cowardice and Toryism. Yesterday, was buried Monsieur Du Coudray, 
a French officer of artillery, who was lately made an Inspector-General 
of artillery and military manufactures, with the rank of Major-General. 
He was drowned in the Schuylkill, in a strange manner. He rode into 
the ferry-boat, and rode out at the other end into the river, and was 
drowned. His horse took fright. He was reputed the most learned and 
promising officer in France. He was carried into the Romish Chapel, and 
buried in the yard of that church. This dispensation will save us much 
altercation.^

of all wise Men, my counsel is not always attended to. no wise man 
however can suffer with more patience and indifference. Some who 
smiled at the proposition are gone in a hurry, embarrassed â€” others are 
now on the wing, we keep enough to make a Congress and thats all. 
I shall remain as long as any. I sent my baggage forward some days 
ago and can easily transport my self, but I am really in a comfortable 
State of confidence that General Washington will be victorious in the next 
engagement which will probably happen this Evening or tomorrow, be 
that as it may I am ready to go or to remain and may do either with a

that the members of Congress were gone, some of them, a little after 
midnight ; that there was a letter from Mr. Hamilton, aid-de-camp to the 
General, informing that the enemy were in possession of the ford and the

that, if Congress was not removed, they had not a moment to lose.^ Mr.

for his curiosity, or his rashness. He relates in this letter to Trumbull : " I was robbed 
of my Pocket Book in the twinkling of an Eye last f ryday Even?, at the Coflfea-House, 
containing 260 Dollrs with 15 or more Lottery Tickets belonging to Col. Whipple, 
and some Papers of my own." Sept. 24, Lovell wrote to Elbridge Gerry from Phila- 
delphia (besides relating the loss of his pocket-book) : " By all I can find you will be 

so sick of Lancaster as to determine upon York speedily Mr. S. A. was little 

inclined to go to Lancaster; but I do not think he will quit before the Confedn. is 
gone through." This letter was among the Gerry papers at one time in the possession 
of W. R. Benjamin of New York.

- Such a letter of this date from Washington has not been found, neither is 
there mention of it in the Journals. A letter of Sept. 23, containing a passage relative 
to the collection of shoes and blankets in Lancaster, was read in Congress at their 
meeting in Lancaster, Sept. 27 (see nos. 657, 660, post). This letter was addressed to 
" Honble Jno. Hancock Esq. ; or any Member of Congress, Lancaster ", and the opening 
sentence says: "I have not had the honor of addressing you since your adjournment 
to Lancaster"; nevertheless, Gerry's letter of Sept. 25 (no. 655, post), as also Washing- 
ton's letters to Gerry, Sept. 26 and 27 (see below, and no. 655, post), are evidence that 
the letter of Sept. 22 is not identical with that of Sept. 23. Replying to Gerry, Sept. 
26, Washington says : " When I wrote Congress, I was informed, that there were several 
arms in Lancaster belonging to the public. These with their accoutrements, I wished 
to be collected and put into the Hands of the Militia coming from Virginia. But I did 
not mean that any the property of Individuals, should be taken, because I did not 

conceive myself authorised, nor do I at this time to order such a measure The 

Army is much distressed for blankets and shoes, and I wish the most vigorous exertions 
could be pursued to make a collection, the speediest possible, in the neighborhood where 
you are." (Library of Congress, Washington Papers.)

Tuesday, 30 September, 1777. 
My Best Friend, 

It is now a long time since I had an opportunity of writing to you, and 
I fear you liave suffered unnecessary anxiety on my account. In the 
morning of tlie 19th instant, the Congress were alarmed in their beds by 
a letter from Mr. Hamilton, one of General Washington's family, that the 
enemy was in possession of the ford over the Schuylkill and the boats, so 
that they had it in their power to be in Philadelphia before morning. 
The papers of Congress belonging to the Secretary's office, the War 
office, the Treasury office etc., were before sent to Bristol. The President, 
and all the other gentlemen were gone that road, so I followed with my 
friend Mr. Marchant, of Rhode Island, to Trenton, in the Jerseys. We 
stayed at Trenton until the 21st, when we set off to Easton, upon the 
forks of Delaware. From Easton we went to Bethlehem, from thence to 
Reading, from thence to Lancaster, and from thence to this town, which 
is about a dozen miles over the Susquehannah river. Here Congress is 
to sit. In order to convey the papers with safety, which are of more 
importance than all the members, we were induced to take this circuit, 
which is near a hundred and eighty miles, whereas this town, by the 
direct road, is not more than eighty-eight miles from Philadelphia. This 
tour has given me an opportunity of seeing many parts of this country 
which I never saw before.^ 

This morning Major Troup arrived here with a large packet from 
General Gates, containing very agreeable intelligence, which I need not 
repeat, as you have much earlier intelligence from that part than we have. 
I wish affairs here wore as pleasing an aspect. But alas, they do not.^ 

I shall avoid every thing like history, and make no reflections. How- 
ever, General Washington is in a condition tolerably respectable, and the 
militia are now turning out from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania 
in small numbers. All the apology that can be made for this part of the 
world is, that Mr. Howe's march from Elk to Philadelphia, was through 
the very regions of passive obedience. The whole country through which 
he passed is inhabited by Quakers. There is not such another body of 
Quakers in all America, perhaps not in all the world

v^ill be sent this afternoon to Lancaster for that purpose, therefore tran-

York in Pennsylvania, Octr 2d 1777 
Dear Sir 

I reed yours of the i6th Sepr., and not having attended the Treasury 
of late from the Want of Health, was unacquainted with the Order of 
the Board before the rect. of your Letter. 

I think that your Request is reasonable, and as Philadelphia is now in 
the Hands of the Enemy, that you cannot be accommodated in any other 
Place where Congress shall meet, were there no other objections to the 
removal of the Commiss. ; but of these there are undoubtedly many, and 
such as cannot be easily answered, when the Board meets I shall propose 
a Reversal of the order." 

The Loss of Philadelphia was unexpected, and had it been in any other 
State than Pennsylvania, Delaware or Maryland, I question whether it 
would have happened, but as General Washington's army will be rein- 
forced in a Day or tw^o with 3000 of the Virginia Militia, 1500 Contin.

Philadelphia. I wish those dispatches may have got safe to hand. Con- 
gress at their first meeting at Lancaster adjourned to York town 22 miles 
farther Southward, and 10 from the Susquehanna. Lancaster they found 
crowded and in other respects exceptionable. Here we are at least sufh- 
cientlv retired and can deliberate without interruption.^ ....

The Congress left Philadelphia the 19th. at 2 oClock A. M. I returned from 
Bristol to the Capital to dine, and tarried till the 25th; when, the Enemy 
being within a mile and without any opposing Troops in the City, I slipt 
into the Jersies. It was lucky that I had a young Lady to gallant thither ; 
for 3 or 4 Officers who left Philadelphia before me were taken in the Franck-

appear to contain no record of action upon it. The letter protests against certain expres- 
sions in the proceedings of Congress Sept. 6 (Journals, p. 716), concerning the action of 
the deputy paymaster-general, and explains the letter of General Gates of Aug. 28, upon 
which the action w^as based.

Upon the present ill Aspect, some People in Congress seem to intend 
to reform their mode of doing- or rather no^-doing Business, and I 
believe we shall be able to get speedily thro' the Articles of Confedera- 
tion, and shall sit faithfully about the means of keeping our Currency 
in some sort of Credit : I know nothing radical for the Purpose but Taxa- 
tion, high and payable at short Periods. Every Thing else is only a 
Palliative.* .... 

The Gentleman who delivers this has received an Advantage from yr. 
Recommendation ; * but as there was an old Resolution upon the Journals 
.that "Congress would take an early Opportunity to promote Majr. 
Livingston ", which was not recollected, when a Motion in his favour was 
made upon his coming to tell from Genl. Schuyler what Genl. Lincoln 
had written about Brigadr. Stark's Fighting, this Opportunity when Mr. 
Throop came properly from a Battle was taken to bring into Effect the 
mentioned Record. Thus both the Young Gentlemen are promoted.^ 
I hope Stark will not make the same Puzzle as another Officer has made 
about the Date of his new Rank ; Â® For I think it impossible that in one 
Case or the other Congress should antedate without the greatest Confu- 
sion. One Case had been absolutely determined before any Knowledge 
of the Anecdote which I have before hinted at, which would have fixed 
me if I had not been fixed before.'' .... 

I hope one or two late Alterations with the Power of filling Places will 
make the Commissary and Quartermasters Department of some better use 
to you than they have been lately.* 

I will not urge you to be particular to me till you have more Leisure 
than you had when Mr. Throop left you ; but be assured that I am. Sir, 

Your Friend and Most humb Servt.

of May 26, respecting the loan and the mode of raising it by appropria-

4 Robert Troup (Lovell here spells the name "Throop"). See note 5, below; 
also nos. 660, 662, ante. 

5 The promotions of Robert Troup and Henry Brockholst Livingston were 
made Oct. 4. Cf. no. 669, ante. For the earlier action concerning Livingston, see the 
Journals, Sept. 25, 1776, and Aug. 22, 1777 (erased entry). It is difficult to escape the 
impression that Congress was more zealous in promoting the persons who brought good 
news than those who performed good services. The promotion of James Wilkinson for 
bringing Gates's despatches concerning the surrender of Burgoyne is one of the most 
extraordinary. See the Journals, Oct. 31, Nov. 6, and no. 728, note 2, post. 

6 The allusion is probably to the case of Benedict Arnold. See the Journals 
Aug. 8, Nov. 29, and nos. 582, 583, 585, 586, 607, ante.

a 



tion of vacant land.* It remains doubtful yet whether there is any vacant 
land not included within the charter limits of some one of the thirteen 
States, and it is an undetermined (|uestion of j^reat maj^nitude whether 
such land is to be considered as common stock, or the exclusive property 
of the State within whose charter bounds it may be found.* 

Until this business has been determined in Congress and approved by 
the States you will readily discover the difficulty of doing anything in 
the way of raising money by appropriation of vacant land. We consider 
your proposal on this subject as of very great importance, and we shall 
not fail to solicit the attention of Congress thereto whenever the pressing 
business of the campaign will permit. 

In the mean time we see no reason that should prevent the young 
nobleman of Irish extract from coming to America, because the sus- 
pension of the question concerning vacant lands will not obstruct his 
views of getting the quantity he may want, either by original entry or 
by purchase on the most reasonable terms, upon the frontiers of those 
States where vacant lands are in abundance to be met with. We are 
warranted to say that such rank as that nobleman may have when he 
leaves service in Europe will be granted to him here. Congress clearly 
discern with you, gentlemen, the all-important concern of supporting the 
credit of the continental money, and with this view have proposed, as 
you will see by the inclosed resolves, to pay the interest of twenty millions 
of dollars by bills drawn on you. 

This we hope will in time replenish the loan offices so effectually as, 
with the aid of taxation now generally taking place, to prevent the 
necessity of future emissions. By your letters of the 25th of May we have 
no doubt but these interest bills will be paid with all due punctuality. 
About five millions only of the twenty voted are yet borrowed, and the 
interest on those five will not be drawn for in bills till near a twelve- 
month.*

2 The letter referred to seems to be missing. In Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., 
II. 325, is a letter from Franklin and Deane, dated May 26, but it does not discuss the 
question of defraying the cost of the war by the sale of vacant lands. Such a scheme 
was, however, proposed by Deane in a letter dated Dec. i, 1776. None of the existing 
letters of the commissioners mention " the young nobleman of Irish extract ". This 
was probably Count Arthur Dillon. A sketch of him is in Appleton, Cyclo. Am. Biog.

made of the abilities and merits of the Baron, nevertheless from certain 
delicacies respecting rank on his part and other circumstances which are 
unnecessary to recapitulate the business which Congress had so much at

Sir:â€” 

.... Congress have once more begun to tliink of confederation. I 
could wish to know tlie sentiments of our General Assembly upon some 
Capital points. The method of voting by States was yesterday deter- 
mined, viz, that each State should have one vote, no colony against it but 
Virginia. The grand point of settling the Quota of Taxes each State is 
to pay, comes on this afternoon. Three proposals have been made, one 
to tax by the Poll, another to assess the value of the Lands, and the other 
to assess property in general. The latter at present I think most equitable, 
should the Confederation be agreed upon Mr. Penn and myself will 
embrace the earliest opportunity of transmitting it to your Excellency, 
to be laid before the General Assembly. The Delegates of the several 
States are exceedingly anxious to finish this business, many assert that 
the very Salvation of these States depend upon it; and that none of the 
European powers will publicly acknowledge them free and independent, 
until they are confederated.^ The time of Congress ever since my arrival 
has been chiefly taken up with army matters. 

We have as yet no printing press, or Post Oflfice established here, this 
will be done in a few days.' I shall then have it more in my power to 
communicate to your Excellency every piece of interesting intelligence 
which comes to hand, at present I can hardly find time to write a letter. 
Congress sits from morning 'till night, and Committees 'till 10 and 1 1 
o'clock. In fact I am almost tired of my troublesome ofifice, and heartily 
wish to be with my family. I have not time to enlarge, but have the honor 
to be with respect your Excellency's most obdt and very huml Servant,

2 See no. 679, note 4, ante. Some statements in this letter indicate that the 
date should probably be Oct. 8. Harnett says : " The method of voting by States was 
yesterday determined." That point was decided Oct. 7. He further says : " The 
grand point of settling the Quota of Taxes each State is to pay, comes on this after- 
noon." This suggests that the discussion of Oct. 9 had not yet taken place. The 
resolution of the afternoon of Oct. 8 may, however, be the first determination of a date 
for the discussion of article IX., and not a postponement. It may be remarked, further, 
that in the opening of the letter Harnett mentions that he. had received Caswell's 
letter of Sept. 2 two days ago. John Penn, in a letter to Caswell, Oct. 5, says that he 
had just received Caswell's letter of Sept. 2, to him. These letters from Caswell must 
have arrived at the same time. Cf. nos. 681, 683, 701, 712, 723, 733, 747, 749, post.

2 Sullivan's letter, dated Sept. 27, was read in Congress Oct. 10. See nos. 645, 647, 
ante, and nos. 684, 686, 702, post. 

3 See the Journals, Oct. 7, and no. 680, ante, no. 683, post. The incident men- 
tioned in the following correspondence between John Adams and Henry Marchant, of 
Rhode Island, in 1789, probably relates to the proceedings of Oct. 7, upon the method 
of voting under the Confederation. In a letter to Marchant, Aug. 18, 1789, Adams says: 

" The solemn declaration, which you call prophetic, and say has come to pass, made 
on the floor of Congress, respecting the late confederation, just as we had closed it, 
I do not distinctly recollect. I should be much obliged to you if you would write me as 
particular an account of it as you can recollect." {Works, IX. 559.) 

Marchant responded : 

"When my friend has all his feelings wound up upon an important subject, and vent 
must be given, he has a manner of expression so peculiar to himself, and so striking to 
his hearers, that the impression, as from a stroke of lightening, is left behind, while the 
flash and sound, the mode of expression, is lost or forgotten. His words I will not 
engage to recollect with exactness. 

" The articles of confederation being completed, the members by rotation were 
called to place their signatures to them. This being concluded, a pause and perfect 
calm succeeded. He sat and appeared full of thought. He rose. ' Mr. President.' 
His cane slipped through his thumb and forefinger, with a quick tap upon the floor; 
his eyes rolled upwards; his brows were raised to their full arch. 

" ' This business, sir, that has taken up so much of our time seems to be finished. 
But, sir, I now, upon this floor, venture to predict that, before ten years this confedera- 
tion, like a rope of sand, will be found inadequate to the purpose, and its dissolution will 
take place. Heaven grant that wisdom and experience may then avert what we have 
most to fear ! ' 

" I never knew a greater solemnity upon the minds of the members. It was near the 
usual time of adjournment. Congress was adjourned." 

Adams replied : " Your account of the prophecy is humorous enough, but you must 
be mistaken in the point of time. I left Congress on the nth of November, 1777, that 
year which the Tories said, had three gallowses in it, meaning the three sevens, just 
as Congress had gone through the confederation, but before it was signed. My name 
is not to that confederation ; so that the prediction must have been uttered either at 
Yorktown, a day or two before I left it, or before, at Philadelphia. 

" I recollect some expressions of that sort, on the floor of Congress, in Philadelphia, 
immediately after the determination that the votes should be by States, and not by 
numbers, a point which Wilson and I labored with great zeal. After that determination 
and some others, I own I gave up that confederation in despair of its efficacy or long 
utility." (Works, III. 70, note.) If Adams is correct in assigning this incident to the 
occasion of the determination of the method of voting, he is of course in error in stating 
that it took place in Philadelphia.

(Thomas Wharton, jr.)-^ 

York Town, Octr loth, 1777. 

Dear Sir, 

I am honored with your favor of this date, and with concern I find the 
alarm taken by the State at tlie hint thrown out respecting the calhng of 
the Convention in a few hasty hues, the production of a very few minutes 
wliile the Express waited.^ As my time is too much engross'd to take 
Copies of my Letters I cannot recur to what I wrote, but I meant only to 
convey this Idea that some real Friends of our State Members of Congress 
were of Opinion that the salvation of the State depended on calling of 
a Convention, which was construed by Council and Assembly, as appears 
from a Letter I am honored with from the Speaker, confirmed by the 
Attorney General, into a serious Intention in Congress of interfering in 
the internal Police of our State, so far at least as to influence into the 
measures in Question, whereas it arose in a tete a-tete betwixt some, as I 
have already said, real Friends and myself, nor will you be surprised with 
the sentiment when you are acquainted with the motives. It was publickly 
and confidently said in and out of Congress, that a Quorum of the Legis- 
lature could not be got together. And as the necessity of the times 
required the most vigorous measures, and the season for taking the sense 
of the people for or against a Convention was at hand, their voice in 
Convention to lay down a system to be executed by Committees of that 
Body, dispers'd thro' the State, was thought the best succedaneum for the 
want of an established Legislature, and such Laws competent to the 
emergency of the times, which were not provided. That these Exertions 
were necessary to the Salvation of the State, and its safety and liberty 
would be provided for better than by the interference of Congress, until 
such Convention had appointed a Legislative Body. This was thought 
the best Expedient for these Reasons, and might prove a healing measure 
to our unhappy Divisions. A mistake of the day of Election and that the 
Constitution had appointed the first Tuesday of this present month, v^^hich 
I could not contradict (as in the hurry of removing my Copy containing 
the Constitution, was mislaid) influenced to the hint offered you as above, 
for in this place there was not the least appearance of an Election, from 
whence it was judged that the people were in such a maze that the day 
of Election had throughout the State elapsed irrevocably (nor could I 
satisfy Enquirers on this head), or at best, that a partial election would 
obtain, and our Country continue to suffer through want of exertion. 
Thus was I distracted until Dr. Ewing informed me that the Assembly 
and Council were preparing the most salutary laws, of which I am more 
fully convinced by the specimen of one put into my hands by Mr. 
Sergeant, which rejoiced my heart, and is a full proof that under my 
apprehensions, there was no other way of supplying the very powers given 
but by a Convention. I heartily congratulate you on the concurring pro-

afraid of the reproach of your dastardly foes who by and by if you boldly

686. Thomas Burke to John Sullivan.^ 

York Oct. 12, 1777. 

Sir, 

I was present at the action of Brandywine and saw and heard enough 
to convince me that the fortune of the day was injured by miscarriages 
where you commanded ^ 

I understood you were several days posted with the command on the 
right wing; that you were cautioned by the Commander in Chief early 
in the day to be particularly attentive to the enemy's motions, who, he 
supposed would attempt to cross higher up the creek and attack your 
flank; that you were furnished with proper troops for reconnoitering, 
and yet you were so ill informed of the enemy's motions, that they came 
up at a time and by a route which you did not expect ; that you conveyed 
intelligence to the Commander in Chief which occasioned his counter- 
manding the dispositions he had made for encountering them on the rout 
by which it afterwards appeared they were actually advancing: That 
when at length the mistake was discovered you brought up your own 
Division by an unnecessary circuit of two miles, and in the greatest dis- 
order, from which they never recovered, but fled from the fire of the 
enemy without resistance. That the miscarriages on that wing made it 
necessary to draw off a great part of the strength from the centre, which 
exposed Gen. Wayne to the superiority of the enemy. 

I heard officers in the field lamenting in the bitterest terms that they 
were cursed with such a commander ; and I overheard numbers during the 
retreat complain of you as an officer whose evil conduct was forever 
productive of misfortunes to the army. From these facts I concluded 
that your duty as a General was not well performed, otherwise the enemy's 
motions on the wing where you commanded would not have been un- 
known to you during a great part of the day of action; nor could they 
have advanced by an unknown and unexpected rout, for you ought to 
have made yourself wtII acquainted with the ground. Nor would you 
have brought up your troops by an unnecessary circuit and in disorder, 
w^hich exposed them to be surprised and broken. 

I also concluded that the troops under your command had no confidence 
in your conduct, and from the many accounts I had officially received of 
your miscarriages I conceived and am still possessed of an opinion that 
you have not sufficient talents for your rank and office, tho' I believe you

have strong; dispositions to dischargee your duty well. I consider it as 
one essential part of my duty to attend to the appointments of the army 
and where I perceive that any person so unqualified as I deem you to be, 
has gfot into a command where incomj^etence may be productive of dis- 
asters and disg^race, it is my duty to endeavour at removing him. In 
discharge of this I gave to Congress all the information I was able, care- 
fully distinguishing what I saw, what I heard, and from whom as far as 
I was acquainted with persons I urged your recal with all the force I 
could, and thought it and still do think it necessary for the public good : 
because in all your enterprises and in every part of your conduct, even as 
represented by yourself, you seem to be void of judgment and foresight 
in concerting, of deliberate vigour in executing, and of presence of mind 
under accidents and emergences; and from these defects seem to me to 
arise your repeated ill success. These seem to me to form the great 
essentials of a military character. Nor do I think you the only officer 
in our army who is deficient in them. Nor were my endeavours to free 
the army from insufficient officers intended to be confined to you. I 
scarcely know your person, and was not conscious of any injury from you. 
For a particular reason I should have had great pleasure in justly forming 
a better opinion of you ; but no reason can induce me to overlook the 
defects of officers on whom so much depends. Nor will any thing deter 
me from pursuing the measures suggested by my own judgment. I have 
now related every thing which I acted, with relation to you in Congress, 
together w-ith my motives. I have set down every intelligence, and the 
opinion I gave concerning you. What hills you struggled for, what fires 
you sustained, I neither saw or heard of. Your personal courage I med- 
dled not with. I had no knowledge of it and I was cautious to say 
nothing unjust or unnecessary. My objection to you is. want of sufficient 
talents, and I consider it as your misfortune, not fault. It is my duty 
as far as I can, to prevent its being the misfortune of my country. 

The purpose of this information is that you may indubitably know I 
gave Congress all the intelligence and opinions concerning you here set 
down ; and then to ask you in direct terms if you meant the disrespectful 
expressions in your late letter to Congress on the subject of your conduct 
at Brandywine, to be applied to me? If you did sir, I must inform you, 
you are mistaken in the matter contained in those expressions. My 
demeanour was entirely devoid of parade and ostentation and entirely 
simple and attentive. I did not gallop my horse at all but when t 
attempted to rally some of your flying troops. The manner of those 
expressions, which I suppose you meant for wit and sarcasm, is as unbe- 
coming the soldier as the gentleman, and inconsistent with that plain 
and dignified simplicity which ought to be the stile of persons in either 
rank. Were quaint witticisms my talent I should not [remainder miss-

York the 20th. October 1777 
Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the i6th ^ I received yesterday, and was a good deal 
surprised to find you had been told that Congress had appointed General 
Conway a Major General. No such appointment has been made, nor do 

letter with its enclosure is found in Pa. Arch., first ser., V. 676. Putnam's letter to 
Washington, Oct. 16, is in Letters to Washington (ed. Sparks), II. 5. In N. C. Stale 
Recs., XI. 653, Clinton's letter covering the Albany letter appears without his signature, 
the whole covered by a note of Hugh Smith, postmaster at headquarters of the Northern 
army (see Pa. Arch., first ser., V. 703). This is no doubt the enclosure mentioned in 
Harnett's letter to Governor Caswell, Oct. 20, quoted above. Cf. nos. 700, 703, 704, 708, 
711, 713, 714, 719, 72y-72>o, post. The announcement of the surrender was premature. 
Burgoyne's offer of surrender was made on the 14th, the convention was signed on the 
i6th, and the actual surrender took place on the 17th. The articles of convention are 
in the N. Y. Hist. Soc, Gates Papers, and are found both in print and in facsimile in 
the society's Bulletin, vol. III., no. 3, p. 89 (October, 1919). Gates's letter of Oct. 18 
announcing the capitulation was not received by Congress until Oct. 31. This letter, that 
of Oct. 20, and an enclosure of the 19th (see the Journals, Oct. 31) are found in Pa.

I believe it will, whilst it is likely to produce the evil consequences you 
suj^f^est. It is very true, that both within and without doors, their have 
been Advocates for the measure, and it has been affirmed that it would 
be very aj^reeable to the army, whose favorite Mr. Conway was asserted 
to be. My judgement on this business was not formed until I received 
your letter. I am very sure Congress would not take any step that might 
injure the Army, or even have a tendency that way; and I verily believe 
they wish to lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, from 
an entire conviction that the purest motives of public good direct your 
actions.' 

The business of a Board of War is so extensive, so important, and 
demanding such constant attention, that Congress see clearly the necessity 
of constituting a new Board out of Congress, whose time shall be entirely 
devoted to that essential department.* 

It is by some warmly proposed that this board shall be filled by the 
three following gentlemen, Colo. Read,^ Colo. Pickering the present 
Adjutant General, and Colo. Harrison your Secretary. And that Gen. 
Conway be appointed A. G. in the room of Colo. Pickering. It is my 
wish, and I am sure it is so of many others, to know your full and candid 
sentiments on this subject. For my own part, I cannot be satisfied with 
giving any opinion on the point until I am favored with your sentiments, 
which I shall be much obliged to you for Sir as soon as your time will 
permit. It has been affirmed that Gen. Conway would quit the service 
if he were not made a M. General. But I have been told, in confidence, 
that he would leave it at the end of this Campaign if he was appointed, 
unless his word of honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. 
And it is a question with me whether the Advocates for Gen. Conway 
will not miss their aim if he should be appointed A. General, unless he has 
the rank of Maj. General also. My reason for thinking so, is, that I have 
been informed Gen. Conway desires to retire to his family, provided he 
can carry from this country home with him, a rank that will raise him 
in France. 

It is very certain that the public good demands a speedy erecting and 
judicious fining of the new Board of War; and I sincerely wish it may 
be done in the most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress would 
appoint Colo. Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare 
him, nor do I think that so important an office as that of A. G. should be 
touched without maturest consideration.

weight with or after the Confederation, there are reasons for this, tho I 
am not satisfied it is best to [wait for that] so long as this will necessarily 
carry it. [The ex]orbitant rise of every article etc. as [well as] depre-

Honored Sir: 

The inclosiires will show you how solicitous Congress are to have the 
Continental battalions filled up and deserters apprehended. The extracts 
from Gen. Washington's letter discovers his anxiety upon the subject, 
and that although he has wrote to the states upon the subject, he has 
received information but from one or two.^ .... 

We, last Sabbath week, had accounts very direct from Albany that 
Gen. Burgoyne had surrendered himself and his whole army to Gen. 
Gates, but to this hour Congress has not a word further from that quarter. 
This raised doubts with us, but before this, if it be true, you are well 
informed.^ .... 

I have daily expected to see William Ellery. If any accident happens to 
prevent his coming, I hope another gentleman will be appointed. Indeed, 
that was to have been done long since ; I informed the House at my first 
choice, I would by no means be absent more than six months. My 
affairs at home will not permit it, nor did I prepare myself for a later 
reason, so that I must return next month. By that time, however, I hope 
we shall have finished the long wished for Confederation, which we have 
at times been upon ever since I came, but lately taken up with more 
earnestness.* My presence, I presume, may be necessary when this comes 
before the General Assembly for their approbation, that they may be more 
particularly acquainted with the subject than they would be from a mere 
view of the articles of it.

Sir, 

The inclosed resolve will explain to you the design of our appointment, 
and the reason of our present application.^ As a friend to the cause of 
America, and as a Gentleman living on the spot which has been Colo. 
Morgans scene of action since his appointment under the United States, 
we are to request of you Sir your candid sentiments on the subject of 
charge against Colo Morgan and you will further oblige us by obtaining 
the fair and uninfluenced testimony of disinterested persons on the same 
point. We wish to be well informed touching the political character of 
Mr. McGee,* whether he is considered as an Agent or Friend, of G. B. 
and whether he does not profess himself a Subject of the British King. 
Whether Colo Morgan has much intimacy with Mr. McGee and whether 
the latter was not carried by the former along with him on a visit to some 
of the Indian nations, and whether it was by Colo Morgans influence that 
the Indians were induced to insist on Mr. McGees continuing to reside 
where he now does. Whether any letter has been seen from Mr. Hamil- 
ton the Governor of Detroit to Colo. Morgan, and what were the contents 
of such letter. We are satisfied that you will excuse the trouble we have 
here given you, when you reflect how important a thing it is that the 
department of Agent for Indian Affairs should be filled by a person of 
clear and unquestioned attachments to the United States, and the impos- 
si[bility, fro]m our remoteness, of rightly answering the end of our 
[appointme]nt, unless by the mediation of American friends in [that 
part o]f the Country. We are Sir your most obedient Servants

My dear Sir, 

I have just receivd your agreeable Letter of the 8th by the Post, for 
which please to accept my hearty thanks. I had written and seald the 
inclosd Letter,^ before yours came to my Hand. Yesterday Morning Mr. 
H[ancock], who had several times before given Notice to Congress of 
his Intention to return to Boston agreeable to Leave he had obtaind at 
Philadelphia, made a formal Speech to Congress in which he reminded 
them of his having served them as President more than two years; 
whether he had conducted to their Approbation or not, was left to them ; 
but he had the Testimony of his own Mind that he had done it to the best 
of his Ability. He thanked them for the Civility they had shown him, 
and if in the Course of Business he had faild in due Respect to any Mem- 
ber, as it was not intentional, he hoped it would be overlooked. It is 
likely as I have taken it from Memory upon hearing it once read, that I 
have not done it Justice in point of Expression. But it is not improbable 
that you may have a Copy of it; for a Motion was made in the Afternoon 

by Mr. D of N. Y.^ that a Copy should be requested, and Thanks 

returnd for his great Services, and a Request that he would return and 
take the Chair. This Motion was opposd by several Members, but it 
obtaind so far as to request the Copy, and this Day the latter Part of the 
Motion will be considerd.* 

I have given you this merely as a Peice of News, leaving you to judge 
of the Tendency and probable Effect of the Speech and Motion. We have 
had two Presidents before, Neither of whom made a parting Speech or 
receivd the Thanks of Congress.

believe will generally be found to be nearly in proportion to the numbers 
that can be supported in a State, and wealth principally arises from the 
labour of men. as to the negros I should be willing to do what appears 
equitable. If for the present it should be agreed to exclude all under ten 
years old or any other age that may be agreed on and include the rest 
until a more equitable value can be devised, and not make a perpetual rule 
at present would it not answer better than to have confederation delayed, 
for I am persuaded that the States can neither agree to nor practise the 
mode voted by Congress, and nothing effectual can be done to fix the 
credit of the currency or to raise necessary supplies until some rule of 
proportion is adopted. I doubt not of your readiness to do whatever you 
shall Judge may conduce to the general good and I am sure your influence 
will have great weight in this affair.^ ....

My dear Sir, 

I wrote to you last Week by Mr. Hancock =" and gave you a curious 
Anecdote. The affair was brought onâ€” it labord a whole Afternoon. 
The Principle was objected to, it was urged to be unprecedented, impoli- 
tick, dangerous. The Question was then put of the Propriety of the 
Measure in any Instance. Passd in the Affirmative 6 to 4. The original 
Question was then put. Passd in the Afifve., the same Division. The 
Yeas and Nays were called for: yeas, C, N. Y., J, V, N. C, S. C. Nays, 
N. H., M. R., P. Adieu.^

of the committee of the Eastern states, brought in Oct. 27 and acted upon Nov. 22, 26,

"first motion" (p. 854). Maryland is not included, because, having but one member 
present, the state was " imrepresented ". Adams's statement that the vote on the 
general' question of propriety was in the affirmative, 6 to 4, does not accord with the 
Journals, which show the states equally divided. The Journals do record, however, 
an affirmative vote on the question whether the sense of Congress should be taken on a 
" general proposition ".

Tyaguin, November 4th, 1777. 
Prar Sir: 

I left York town, in Pennsylvania, on the 13th iilto., and arrived at 

home on the 26th. after our retreat from Philadelphia While I 

was at Reading happened the battle of Chestnut Hill and Germantown, 
wherein we unfortunately lost General Nash, one of the best, the most 
respected and regretted officers in the Continental army. The particulars 
of this battle Mr. Harnett informed me he wrote you before my arrival 
at York, and I will not trouble you with a repetition. Upon the whole, 
it appears our miscarriage sprung from the usual source â€” want of abili- 
ties in our superior officers and want of order and discipline in our army. 
This, sir, is an evil of most dangerous tendency, and to remedy it has 
been long the object of my thoughts and endeavors. Indeed, I saw very 
little propect of success until very lately. But just before I left Congress 
I had the pleasure to find that every gentleman was equally sensible of 
the necessity of applying a proper remedy. The great difficulty will be 
to get over particular connections and personal regards, but it must be 
effectually remedied or all our efforts are in vain.^ .... 

Very little of consequence has been lately determined in Congress. 
The Confederation was the subject of daily consideration when I came 
away. But as I consider the plan now in embryo as what can never be 
suited to the States, I think nothing decided on it is of consequence. I 
fear I differ very widely on this subject with a majority in Congress. I 
deem a time of peace and tranquilty the proper time for agitating so im- 
portant a concern ; but some, and not a few, are of opinion that advantage 
should be taken of the present circumstances of the States, which are 
supposed favorable for pressing them to a very close connection. But 
more, sir, of this when we meet.^ ....

from Jeremiah Wadsworth to William Williams (Conn. Hist. Soc, Jeremiah Wads-

" Hartford Nov 26th 1777 
"Sir 

" I am informed that some members of Congress and many other Persons are made 
to believe that the Late Commissy. General has not been ready to deliver over the 
Stores in his Possession to the Persons who have been authorised to receive them and 
that the Publick service has been injured by his delay. I have from his first being in 
Office been acting for him and as Many of the Stores were in my hands at the time he 
left the Army I waited on him at Danbury on his way home when he was dismissed and 
reed his Orders to deliver over all the Stores in my hands to the Issuing Commsy. 
Generals Order agreeable to the Resolves of Congress â€” and after waiting an unrea- 
sonable time for some Person to apply for them I was informed the Army woud be 
distressed if I did not forward the Salted Provisions â€” 'and I sent forward a quantity 
after which Sam Grey Esq'r. D C G of Issues came to me at this place and Asked my 
Advise and Assistance finding himself much embarrassed for want of Particular instruc- 
tions and not knowing the extent of his district. I advised him to Appoint some Person 
to receive the Stores from me and to Issue Provisions here. He replied he was at a loss 
for a Proper Person and desired me to let one of my People undertake it. I agreed that 
Mr Hall then in my business and very necessary to me â€” should undertake it. Mr. 
Gray gave him a Warrant â€” and orders to rec[e]ive the Salted Provisions and flower 
only â€” which I immediately delivered and supplied teams to transport â€” and before any 
orders came to him to receive the other stores Rum was call'd for of which I sent a 
moderate supply â€” and then informed Mr Gray that no more wou'd be sent unless it 
was first delivered over according to the resolutions of Congress â€” this produced his 
Order to Mr Hall to receive all the Stores in m}' possession which I imediately began 
to deliver and have now very near compleated the delivery of the whole â€” if after this 
there is the least doubt in the Minds of any Members of Congress or other Person 
who has a right to be satisfied I can produce the fullest proof that from the time Col 
Trumbull resigned to this hour the Stores have been ready to be delivered and that 
constant Attention has been given, where the Stores were lodged for that purpose. 
I cou'd add and verify that had Col Trumbulls Assistants done only their Duty and 
waited for Application, the Stores would yet have been in the Magazines where they 
were deposited. Peter Colt Esqr D C G of Purchases will at any time do us the justice 
to say this and the Variety of difficulties he has to encounter will make him more 
acquainted with the disposition of Col Trumbull and his late Assistants â€” without 
whose Assistance he will not be able to proceed in his business â€” Tho he really is as 
well quallified for the Office he holds as any Man [in] this State â€” but the business has 
been so long delayed, that untill he has the Power to create he cannot make ample if 
tollerable supplies."

On the 1st. Inst: Colonel Wilkinson delivered your several dispatches 
to Congress and at their request briefly added a recital of circumstances 
attending the Convention of Saratoga, he has since laid before the 
House all the Papers relative to that Contract and the returns of both 
Armies.^ these have afforded satisfaction not only to the Representative 
body, but universally to the good people here, the glorious Intelligence 
is now extending from City to City diffusing Joy in the heart of every

Book, L 4. 

2 According to the Journals Wilkinson delivered Gates's letter and a copy of 
the convention of Saratoga Friday, Oct. 31, instead of Nov. i, and on Monday, Nov. 3, 
he laid the articles of convention and other papers before Congress. Cf. nos. 719, 727, 
ante. John Penn and Cornelius Harnett wrote to Governor Caswell Nov. 2 : " Yester- 
day Col. Wilkinson arrived here" {N. C. State Recs., XL 667), but there is probably 
an error either in the date of the letter or in the " yesterday ". 

Thomas McKean wrote to John Adams, Nov. 20, 1815: "With respect to General 
VVilkinson I recollect an Anecdote: he was in 1777 an Aid to General Gates, and by 
him sent to Congress at York-town in Pennsylvania with the dispatches, giving an 
account of the surrender of Sir John Burgoj^ne and the British army to the Americans 
at_ Saratoga ; on the way he spent a day at Reading, about fifty miles from Yorktown, 
with a young lady from Philadelphia, whom he afterwards married. When the 
dispatches were read in Congress, propositions were made for paying a proper compli- 
ment to the Favorite of General Gates, who brought us such pleasing news. Governor 
Samuel Adams, with a grave and solemn face, moved Congress, that the young Gentle- 
man should be presented with ' a pair of spurs '." .... (Hist. Soc. of Pa., McKean 
Papers, IV. 48.) To this Adams replied, Nov. 26: "I remember a jocular suggestion 
thrown out in a private Conversation in which Mr Samuel Adams and Mr Hancock 
were present on the morning after Wilkinson's Arrival, and before Congress met: 
that it would be proper to present the Courier with a horsewhip and a pair of Spurrs: 
but I never before heard that a Motion was actually made in Congress, in jest or in 
earnest to that purpose. I must have been absent at that moment upon some Committee." 
Ibid., IV. 4?. 

For Wilkinson's promotion see the Journals, Nov. 6. In his letter of Oct. 18, delivered 
to Congress by Wilkinson, Gates warmly recommended Wilkinson for promotion : 
"I desire to be permitted to recommend this gallant officer in the warmest manner to 
Congress, and intreat that he may be continued in his present place with the Brivet 
of a Brigadier General. The Honble Congress will believe me when I assure them that 
from the beginning of this war, I have not met with a more promising Military Genius 
than Colonel Wilkinson, and whose services have been of the greatest benefit to the 
Army." Pa. Arch., first ser., V. 687. For Wilkinson's own account of his journey with 
the despatches and his audience with Congress, see his Memoirs, I. 323 et seq. 

3 This mode of official designation was adopted by Laurens immediately upon 
his election to the presidency. See, for instance, the circular letter of Nov. i, in Pa. 
Arch., first ser., V. 735. He did not, however, persevere therein.

their sanguine expectations, yet you will not be surprised if it should raise 
the Envie of your Enemies and those who had with Violence opposed 
your Command in that Quarter, but the success which has attended your 
Conduct, and followed your plans of Operation, now forces some Ac- 
knowledgement even from those, of the Prudence of the measure in 
restoring you to your proper Command. I have the pleasure to Inform 
you that Congress are not only happy in the Event, but entirely satisfied

idea of this matter so far. as to believe our affairs must be ruined without 
it. i'.e this as it may, it will in a few days be sent to the Legislatures of

Our time has been chiefly employed in army matters and God knows we 
have had perplexity enough 

Pray let me have your opinion freely and dispassionately on the articles 
of confederation. 

The mode of settling the Quota of each State towards defraying the 
general expense, has taken up much time. Some States were for the 
valuation of all the property in each State. Others, for fixing it by the 
number of Inhabitants. Others on the valuation of land. This last 
seemed to come as near the mark as any, except a valuation of all 
property. However the Value of lands has taken place much against the 
desire of the Delegates from the Eastern States.* 

As I expect you will be directed to return immediately after the rising 
of our assembly, I hope you will take care to be properly instructed in 
every measure they may wish to accomplish. 

You ought to be here. No State should have a less number of Delegates 
than three present in Congress and I hope our State will attend constantly 
to that rule

735. The Pennsylvania Delegates to the President of 

Pennsylvania.^ 

York Town, Novr 13th 1777. 
Sir, 

Congress have referred the inclosed petition to the Council of this 
State, together with which we were desired to furnish a more particular 
account of the Petitioner, Parson Batewell's state of health etc., accord- 
ingly we have just visited him, and found him a prisoner in a private 
house much emaciated, and afilicted with Rhumatic pains in his Knees, 
which incapacitates him for walking, but confessed he was much better 
than while he was in prison. 

He ofTers his parole as well as Bail if he is allowed to go to his former 
place of abode in this County, twenty one miles distant from hence, or 
permitted to take the fresh air, and exercise here, for the recovery of his 
health, wch we are of opinion may effect it. He requests a speedy result 
of your Honble Board that he may sell or remove his effects and three 
children now at the above place, a glebe belonging to the Church, as he 
cannot afford to keep two families. The papers belonging to Mr Batwell 
taken with his person were deposited in the hands of Mr. McClane in this 
Town, who applied to one of us to know how they should be disposed of, 
which was moved to Congress, but they would give no orders concerning 
them, therefore they wait your commands, and are as yet undisclosed, 
except two letters of no great importance communicated to one of us.* 

We have the happiness to inform the state that Confideration has this 
Evening passed Congress, but have it not in our power as yet to communi- 
cate it, as the several articles tho' agreed to are not arranged in the order 
they are to appear, which we hope will be effected tomorrow, as they are 
committed for that purpose, and to have it in our power very soon to lay 
them before the State, therefore we ardently wish a full representation 
of the State may be convened to receive them, and that a Determination 
upon them may be speedily, as the ratification in our opinion is of infinite 
importance to the Independance of America.^ 

We are respectfully. Sir, 

Yr most obt very hum* Servts,

Sir, 

.... Liclosed you will find a Resolve of Congress touching the sub- 
ject of paying the Troops for Rations which implies an approbation of 
the measures you had pursued in that branch, restricting the practice 
within the bounds of necessity to be determined by your judgement." 
Congress have not considered the necessity for sending any of its Mem- 
bers to liquidate extra Accounts. I shall remind the House again of the 
subject that at least somewhat more explicit may be said than I am 
authorized to ofifer at present. 

On the subject of Money, when I pressed the Chairman of the Treasury 
to send you an immediate supply, he informed me that 200000 Dollars 
w^ere on the way to you when you wrote, besides the Order for the like 
Sum on the Connecticut Loan Office, that 200000 Dollars more [had 
been] provided for your department and that with all possible expedition 
a further supply shall be sent.^ 

Demands for a greater Sum than ever was called for at one time, have 
at this juncture conspired to impoverish the Treasury, the business there 
has also been greatly obstructed by the removal of Congress but is now 
restored again to good order and the fund will soon be replenished

Article 4th 

The Constitution of No. Carolina permits not the Privilege of Citizens 
to any who have not resided therein 12 months, and paid Taxes, (local 
protection is given to all within the Territory) the Legislature therefore 
cannot ratify an artikle which gives such priviliges to persons residing in 
other States. Our Commons are voted for by all free Citizens, and if 
the Inhabitants of our Neighboring States have the priviliges of Citizens 
in ours they might insist upon the right of voting for Members of Our 
Legislature which would be a political absurdity, it seems therefore 
proper that this article should be Amended by adding after the clause 
refer'd to â€” tiot inconsistant zvith their respective Constitutions: The 
Provisionary clause of this article, in my opinion, deprives the States of 
every power to increase or regulate their particular Commerce, Agricul- 
ture or Manufactures, they cannot prevent by Duties or restrictions im- 
portations, or Exportations Injurious to any of them, this surely is what 
no staple state ought to admit, and that of all ours, who has so many 
Staples. 

Article 5th 

This article supposes that the appointment of delegates is at the will 
of the Legislature, tis an Error with respect to No. Carolina. Those 
officers are the creatures of the Constitution, are to be annually chozen 
by ballot, and if superceded must be in the same way. no choice can be 
made for less than one year, this article wants alteration if all the states 
are circumstanced as ours, for us I think the following would do " Dele-

2 Although Burke has labeled these comments " Some Notes on the Articles of 
Confederation while in Congress ", they were probably not put together in their present 
form until after his return to North Carolina (see no. 725, ante). Possibly they were 
laid before the joint committee of the two houses of the assembly appointed Dec. 18 to 
report upon the Confederation (see no. 740, note 2, post; cf. note 3, below). The docu- 
ment is placed at this point because the Articles of Confederation as completed are 
recorded in the Journals under Nov. 15.

gates Constitutionally appointed and Controlled by the respective States 
shall annually meet in Congress on the first Monday in November 
The remaining part of this article tho unjust [ ?] in the mode of determm- 
ing Questions, must be submitted to for the sake of public convenience, 
but if the latter clause exempts the Delegates from Prosecutions in their 
respective states for their misdemeanors in Congress, it takes away the 
control of the States, and being contrary to our Constitution cannot be 
admitted. 

Article 6th 

The first clause of this article in my opinion imposes very unnecessary 
restraints upon the States, the various affairs of a free commercial 
People will require them often to enter into Conferences and agreements 
with foreign states, and the commercial Interests of each state ought to 
be its own peculiar care ; and subject [to] no control or Interposition from 
others I can see no propriety in such a Restraint as each State ought, m 
my opinion, to be at least at liberty to enter into any Commercial Treaty 
it may think proper so that it be not inconsistent with Treaties entered 
into by the United States. These seem to me to be of Importance to the 
Staple States, there can be no reason for subjecting them to restraints 
which may arise from the Jealousy or ambition of others, each should 
be at liberty to increase its wealth and strength as much as possible, tis 
sufficient that they be restrained from using them to the Injury of their 
Neighbors, and that they be obliged to contribute in Just proportion to 
the Common defence. The latter part of the first section of this article 

is right. 

The second Section goes too far. the Word Treaty ought to be left 
out. the States will often have occasion to Treat on subjects which con- 
cern none but those engaged in it ; and there can be no reason for restrain- 
ing them from it, if the United States have [power to?] prevent any 
alliance or Compact injurious to the whole it is sufficient, and this purpose 
will be answered by giving them a negative on all Compacts between two 
or more States. 

The third section is right. 

The fourth section so far as it regards the Navy appears to me to be 
impolitic, it speaks a Jealousy which I fear will forever prevent the United 
States from having a powerful Navy, tho' nothing is more Essential to 
its future Security against foreign Enemies, the Emulation of the States 
in this particular ought to be encouraged by every Means, for that Emula- 
tion will be the most powerful Instrument for giving to the whole a for- 
midable Navy, and with such they will be secure against the World. I 
see no reason for the Jealousy, the fleet of one state cannot endanger 
another because they are accessable to each other by Land, and a Sea 
Invasion might very readily be counteracted by a Land Invasion, the 
rest of this Section is right. 

The fifth Section is right in everything but what relates to Indian 
Wars, and it will be difficult to frame an article to suit in this particular. 
I am inclined to think this might be left for the subject of partial alliances, 



r) 

for all the States are not Interested in it and yet Several States have one 
coinnidii Interest in it, and there are still S(M1ic particular Interests in 
which hut one or few states arc concerned. 

Article 7th 

I have no objection to this provided the provision recommended by 
Connecticut takes place/' 

Article 9th 

Tiiis article is exceedingly Comprehensive, its matter is of the greatest 
Importance, but its arrangement seems to me much too Complicated. My 
own Idea of the Power wln'ch Congress ought to possess is founded on the 
following proposition 

The United States ought to be as one Sovereign with respect to foreign 
Powers, in all things that relate to War or where the States have one 
Common Interest. But in all commercial or other peaceful Intercourse 
they ought to be as separate Sovereigns. 

The first is Necessary, because no one can be defended from the evils 
of war but by the united force of all, and to make this force the more 
Effectual their union for its Exertions should be as close and simple as 
possible. 

The Second is Necessary, in order that each may acquire strength to 
as great a degree as its circumstances may admit, without being subject to 
restraints which may arise from the Jealousy of its neighbors, and as 
the growth of each is its own proper concern, and cannot be prejudicial 
to the whole, but on the contrary advantageous to them as long as the 
force acquired is still subject to be applied for the common security, by 
one common ^Magistrate, I can perceive no reason for a power in any 
Common Council which can restrain the Commercial or other peaceful 
intercourse of the States, among themselves, or separately with foreign 
Powers, and it can answer no purpose but to subject the Property of the 
States to partial combinations in the common council. 

A private citizen who embarques a part of his fortune in a Copartner- 
ship would be deemed very unwise should he suffer the members of that 
partnership to possess a power that might restrain him from [improving] 
the remaining part of his Fortune to what extent he pleased consistent 
with the Common Interest, equally unwise in my opinion is it for a State 
who unites with others for common defence to submit to a power which 
may prevent the growth of her Strength and Oppulence. pursuant to 
these propositions my Ideas of the powers which ought to be in Congress 
are as follow. 

In General they should have the Power of declaring War, and peace. 
But wherever a war should be declared before actual Invasion or com- 
mencement or Threatening of some actual Hostilities, any State ought 
to be at Liberty to renounce the War and become a Neutral power but 
w'hen Hostilities are actually commenced against any of the States, it 
ought to be deemed common cause, and none should withhold assistance. 

3 The Connecticut proposition respecting article VII. does not appear in the 
Journals; but a motion affecting article IX. is found ibid., IX. 927. 



November, 1777 '^Â«>'> 

Also they should have the Power of Concluding Treaties of Alliance 
equally binding and affecting the whole for the purpose of strengthening 
the common security, this should be restrained like the former to defence, 
for it ought always to be in the Power of each state to remain Neuter in 
all offensive wars whether the United States be principles or allies in it. 

These Powers necessarily require that the Congress should send and 
receive Embassadors, but not that this Power should be sole and exclu- 
sive. I should like an Amendment to this purpose " shall have the sole 
and exclusive Power of declaring War and concluding Peace, and of send- 
ing, and receiving ambasadors /;/ the name of the United States of Enter- 
ing into Treaties and Alliances equally binding upon, and affecting the 
whole, here the Exceptions to those general rules should come by way of 
provision. The remaining powers in the first section of this article are 
Incident to the power of declaring War, they are only an execution of 
the Law of Nations quoad hoc 

The second section is [b]adly worded. " the United States shall be the 
last resort on appeal in all disputes between the States." I have no Idea 
of an appeal, or last resort unless their be some prior Jurisdiction aiid 
prior resort, and I know of no such thing between the States, but my 
objection to this section is more substantial, if the Congress are to nomi- 
nate the persons who Constitute the Judicatory I can easily foresee it 
will not always if ever be impartial, the Congress cannot know any 
persons to appoint, but such as are Suggested by the parties and that State 
which has the prevailing Interest in Congress will thus nominate all the 
Judges, their being drawn from each State and afterwards drawn by 
Lot is no Security, because three persons in each State are easily cor- 
rupted, if this article were amended by giving the Nomination by ballot 
to the States not Interested it would answer better to my Idea of an Im- 
partial arbiter between the States, and the Congress should have this 
Power only as the Official Instrument for erecting the occasional Tri- 
bunal, and for carrying its decrees into Execution, as it now stands they 
have it too much in their power to Influence the decisions which they 
themselves are to execute which in my Opinion is dangerous in any 
political Community. 

The third section might be easily fitted to the Amendment I propose 

The four[th] section includes many powers which I cannot perceive 
either to be necessary or proper for Congress, regulating the alloy of 
coin struck by authorit}^ of any of the States, fixing the standard of 
weights and measures, regulating the Trade and affairs with Indians, 
and all that Appertains to the Naval force which ought never in my 
opinion to be under any restraint or authority of Congress except in time 
of public War. the first is dangerous, because it gives to a council which 
is composed of but very few members from each state and which is with- 
out control an unlimited power over the property of Individuals, the 
power to increase the alloy is a power to pay off any Debt with less than 
the sum contracted for. and involves an extensive power over property. 

In the fifth Section the power to borrow money and emit Bills, is an 
unlimited power over all property, it is a power to Tax at pleasure, and 



5 

ouj^ht never to be in Conpfress but when g-iven by the States upon special 
Occasions, it is Contrary to the fundamental Maxims of our Constitu- 
tion, vizt [No] Man is to be subject to any Imposition but by [consent 
of] his representatives, the Congress is not the representative of any one 
community, the members are delegates from the Legislatures, not repre- 
sent [at] ives of the people, and the Delegates of one State are not the 
choice of the other states nor has any state a check on the Delegates of 
another state, if the Legislature can delegate their power to tax to any 
person they may Delegate it to the Executive Magistrate, and may make 
him absolute, by giving him the power over the property of the Com- 
munity if they cannot delegate to him they cannot delegate to any other 
the delegation in any case is transferring that power to others which the 
Constitution vests solely in the Legislative Magistrate and is as uncon- 
stitutional as if the Governor or Judges were to substitute other persons 
to exercise their respective powers, or as if the assembly were to appoint 
substitutes to Enact Laws or impower the Delegates in Congress to enact 
Law

*Mr. Waldo G. Leland, of the Department of Historical Research, who found 
this document in the archives of North Carolina in 1905, gives the following description 
of it: "A document of five large pages, undated and unsigned, but entirely in Burke's 
writing and endorsed in his hand, ' Some Notes on the Articles of Confederation while 
in Congress '. The notes were apparently not written at one time, as a few passages are 
in a finer hand, as though written with a smaller pen. The figure '(4)' is endorsed on 
the back, in a blacker ink than that used in the body of the document, as though one 
of several relating to affairs in Congress. The color of the '(4)' corresponds to the 
color of the ink in the rough drafts of Burke's replies to the thanks of the House and 
Senate, Oct. 25, 1779. It is therefore conjectured that he had the papers with him for 
reference when, by request, he attended the assembly on that day." See A''. C. State 
Pecs., XHI. 833, 854, 922, 937, 945. Some comments of Burke upon the Confederation, 
addressed to the assembly and bearing the date Oct. 31, 1779. are ibid., XIV. 349-351 ; 
also in vol. III. of these Letters.

2 This document is without date, but is found in N. C. State Recs., among docu- 
ments of the end of December, 1777, taken " from the Executive Letter Book ". If 
these remarks were actually submitted to the assembly, as the statement at the close 
would seem to indicate, the assembly journals do not record the fact. It is evident, 
however, that they were written before Burke had learned >Jiat the Articles of Confeder- 
ation had been completed and adopted by Congress. That instrument was transmitted to 
the assembly by Governor Caswell Dec. 16 (A'^. C. State Recs., XII. 393) ; therefore the 
remarks were evidently drawn up before that date, probably shortly after the meeting 
of the assembly, Nov. 15. Committees of the two houses were appointed on the Con- 
federation Dec. 18, and on the next day a report was brought in proposing the adoption of 
certain articles and the further consideration of others. This recommendation was 
adopted Dec 24, (See ibid., XII. 221, 229, 263, 400, 449.) At the next session of the 
assembly (April, 1778) the state's delegates in Congress were empowered to ratify the 
Confederation as it stood (ibid., XII. 599, 608, 695, 708, 717; see also ibid., XIII. 102, in, 
452). Cf. no 739, ante.

ing the war against her, and forming foreign alliances as necessary 
thereto. Incident to this must be the General direction of the Army and 
Navy, because they are the instruments of the war. 

Also for the providing the necessary funds for the disbursements, 
because without them neither Army or Navy can subsist. 

Also the making Treaties with Foreign Powers, to be binding on all 
the States alike and equally to affect them, because this is the essence of 
foreign alliance. 

This Idea of the Powers, use and authority of Congress, excludes all 
coercive Interpositions within the States respectively, except with respect 
to the Army and Navy because the States are competent to every exertion 
of power within themselves. Also the appointment of ways and means 
for supplying the Contingents of men, money or other things otherwise 
than by recommendation which always implies a power in the State to 
reject. 

Also the power of imprisoning or otherwise punishing any Citizen, 
because that is not necessary for the end of their Institution, and every 
individual is to be tried and punished only by those Laws to which he 
consents. The Congress for this reason can give no authority to any man 
or set of men to arrest or punish a Citizen, nor can it Lawfully be done 
but by the authority of the particular States. 

Also all pretence for continuance of a Congress after the war is con- 
cluded, or of assuming a power to any other purposes â€” than that are 
above expressed. The Congress now determines by a majority which 
need not be more than five, and of which seven is always conclusive if 
the last mentioned exclusion be not right, the Congress might engage the 
States in confederacies, injurious to all but the continued majority 'Tis 
my opinion that every State has a right to control the Cantonment of 
Soldiers within their Territories, but as all the Governments, are not yet 
settled, it might be inconvenient to say any thing of it, and it is not neces- 
sary. Whenever a State finds occasion to exercise this right, I think none 
will be hardy enough to dispute it. But I believe it will be necessary for 
every established State to provide a mode whereby the Civil authority 
can interpose to prevent Courts Martial from exceeding their Jurisdiction. 

'Tis true a Soldier expressly consents to be bound by the articles of 
war, and to submit to the martial Jurisdiction, but in all trials, the first 
question is the Identity which must raise in this case the enquiry Soldier 
or Citizen? If the Court Martial can determine this question, it is in 
their power to call any Citizen a Soldier, and to subject him to Military 
Law. This evidently points out the necessity of the check of the civil 
authority. This Confederation is a subject of the highest importance, 
but not having yet passed the House, except when in Committee, it seems 
it must not be laid before the Assemblies. I shall deem it my duty to 
examine every article of it with the most critical scrutiny, and submit my 
thoughts to the Assembly, and receive their Instructions. But I am told 
by the President that it will violate my obligation of Secrecy to do this 
before it has passed the House. 

If the Assembly agree with me in the foregoing Ideas, of the Power, 
use and authority of Congress, I beg leave to recommend that they 



558 Coutincntol Cow^rcss 

instruct their Deletjates not to depart from them, nor to consent to any 
act or resolve winch shall tend to exempt the Courts Martial from the 
control of the civil power in the States. 

I am not desirous of these Instructions in order to restrain the Dele- 
gates. I hclieve none of them even without Instructions would vote con- 
trary to those Ideas, but as all questions are carried by a Majority in Con- 
gress, the state may i)erhaps be bound, tho' her Delegates should dissent, 
especially where the Instructions are so general and Powers so indefinite 
as ours. I wish the state therefore to instruct, and by some public act to 
disclaim being bound by any resolves contrary to her Instructions. With- 
out some thing of this kind, according to the present Constitution of Con- 
gress it may be impossible for the Delegates to preserve the Independence 
of the State from Encroachments, for bv that constitution tliev are not 
allowed to protest or enter their Dissent. 

These thoughts are humbly submitted to the Honorable the General 
Assembly of North Carolina by their most respectful Inimble Serv't

Your Letter to Dr. Witherspoon came to my hands after he left Con- 
gress. As I was informed of the Contents of it I opened it and laid Col : 
Dayton's case before Congress. Though they seem fully sensible of the 
merit and services of Col: Dayton yet the many application [s] of a 
similar nature from Officers of the Army made them hesitate about allow- 
ing him a Horse. The affair how^ever was referred to the Board of War. 
Should I not leave Congress soon I will use my influence to obtain the 
Consent of that Board to the measure.' ....

Dear Sir 

Inclosed I send you a letter from Colo. Pendleton. I have waited a 
few days in hopes to be able to mention something to you about your 
Rank. Mr. Jones has been unwell for some days he has determined as 
soon as he can, either to make or second a motion that Justice should be 
done. 

The Congress have settled the precident, in recalling all the Commis- 
sions from the Continental officers of Pennsylva. in order to grant new 
ones, that the proper rank of each officer may be preserved, several extra- 
ordinary promotions having taken place to the prejudice of some officers.^ 

I am under no doubt but we shall do what is right with regard to you 
and Genl. Scott, tho' I can't help being vexed that it has been delayed so 
long. I have had some words ' with .... \_sic] (you can guess) he 
will be agt. you (I suspect) tho' not your State, we have rubbed very hard 
and in publick â€” more than once. I suspect the affair will be done this 
week, as soon as it is I will write you.* You know my opinion of your 
ability and Integrity, also of General Scot, I shall therefore use every 
thing in my power to have Justice done and as soon as possible not from 
Friendship but duty

question of rank involved also two other brigadier-generals of Virginia, Peter Muhlen- 
berg and George Weedon. The relative rank of these four was determined Mar. 19. 
1778. A further controversy however arose as between Woodford and Weedon. This 
was settled Aug. 18, 1778. See Francis Lightfoot Lee to General Weedon, Mar. 31, 1778,

of the weather will permit, but I no sooner express my desire than I find 
myself limited to a few minutes.^ The regulation of the prices of neces- 
saries for the army and the Quota's for each State, until better ascertained 
I expect will be both reported this day by Committee's.^ I acknowledge 
Shelly's affidavit come to hand which I doubt not will satisfy every 
Inquirer. As soon as Confideration is returned from Lancaster compared 
and signed, it will be instantly forwarded to the respective States, with 
a Letter already prepared, warmly urging the passage of it, and that 
Delegates be returned to Congress to confirm a Confideration by the 
loth March, therefore I hope our State will have a Legislative Body 
together to consider this important work, if not assembled in any State 
it is the earnest request of the above hinted address that the Executive 
should immediately call them together.* The alarming account of the 
Depredations on our western Frontier was without delay laid before 
Congress, and a report brought in on too large a scale for the occasion 
as your letter as well as the conjecture of some Members made highly 
probable.^ General Hand as you know, was sent westward authorised 
by this State to call the Militia together for the very purpose now solicited 
by the back Inhabitants,Â® but they, it seems were not in a humour to turn 
out, for this, that and a thousand Reasons which probably could not be 
obviated without violating the Militia Law and Discarding many Officers 
the Genl perhaps not excepted. An inquiry is on foot respecting the 
principles and conduct of Col. Morgan ; but as far as it has gone we find 
the Genl involved in the same predicament, and that it is no other than 
the unreasonable Clamour of some discontented Spirits, however I am 
resolved to go to the bottom if it has any. But I am very apprehensive 
the Duty self interest reigns predominent in the Western as well as every 
other quarter of our Land, and that a desire to enrich themselves has too 
much influence, and that from this principle many lean minds would stir 
up a dust arnong the Savages even at this unseasonable time. Your appli- 
cation I believe v/ill end among other measures in the appointment of 
Commissioners out of Congress to make a full inquiry into their discon- 
tents and particularly into a hellish design of Conspiracy therefore I beg 
the State would immediately furnish me with the names of two Gentlemen 
capable of such a negotiation at Pittsburgh, that I may be ready for a

, . . . Your favorite Confederation is at last finished.^ It only waits 
to be printed and sent on by the President to the Legislatures of the 
several States for their approbation, with a pressing letter from Congress 
on that subject, which you wmII soon see. Our finances are in such a 
situation, that unless the States agree immediately, to tax as high as the 
people can possibly bear, the credit of our money must be ruined. An- 
other very large emission must take place, there is no preventing it. The 
Treasury Boards see the fatal consequence of this measure, but they also 
perceive that when we have no money, we shall have no Army. The 
Loan Offices are already drained to their utmost farthing. The prospect 
before us is truly distressing, we must however continue further emis- 
sions. I tremble at the consequences.^ .... 

P. S. For God's sake endeavour to get some Gentlemen appointed in 
my stead. I can not .=tay here any longer with any pleasure.* 

" Commissioners to go to Fort Pitt were appointed Nov. 20. They were Samuel 
Washington, Gabriel Jones, and Joseph Reed. Reed declined and George Clymer was 
chosen in his stead (see the Journals, Dec. 4, 10, 11). Samuel Washington also declined 
and John Walker was then elected (see the Journals, Jan. i, 1778). On Jan. 10, since 
neither Jones nor Walker had indicated acceptance of the appointment, Congress con- 
ferred upon Governor Henry of Virginia the power to appoint others in their room 
in case they declined. February 23 Congress received notice from Governor Henry that 
he had appointed Sampson Matthews and Samuel McDowell. For further proceedings

748. Richard Henry Lee to George Washington/ 

York 20th November 1777 

Dear Sir, 

I have no doubt of being excused by you for not sooner answering 
your favor of the 24th. last," when you are informed that my ill state of 
health has prevented me from attending as I ought, to the important 
matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, that he might inform Con- 
gress of such parts as it imported the public they should be acquainted 
with. As it appeared by the letters of Gen. Mifflin that he objected only 
to serve in the Quartermasters department, that his health was returning, 
and that he was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, Congress 
appointed him one of the Commissioners of the new Board, because he is 
competent to the right discharge of its duties, because that would best 
suit his valetudinary state, and as shewing a just sense of his uniform, 
vigorous, and well-founded patriotism. I have strong hopes, that by the 
skill and industrv of this new Board, and from the right execution of 
business in that important department, you will in future find great relief.' 

Gen. Conway has not lately been mentioned in Congress, nor has there 
been much talk of an Adjutant General, since it is not certainly known 
whether Colo. Pickering will accept his new appointment. Mr. Flem- 
mings character stands very fair, and so far as I am able to judge, would 
answer well in this commission.* You will see in the inclosed what Mr. 
Sergeant says of him. General Mifflin has proposed a plan for the 
Quartermaster's department that appears judicious, and well fitted to 
answer the purpose of good service and Â©economy at the same time. He 
would divide this department into its military and civil branches, the 
former to be filled by a person well qualified to discharge its duties, and 
the latter, again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of Forage, 
of Tents etc. to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the 
Quarter Master general who is to touch no money but a moderate tho 
sufficient salary.^ .... 

It was most evident to discerning men that the change in the Commis- 
sariat, at the time it was adopted would produce most mischievous conse- 
quences, yet such was the rage of reformation, that no endeavors to pre- 
vent the evil could avail, and now I feel the most anxious solicitude for 
fear the consequences may disperse our army even in face of the enemy."

Dear Sir: 

Inclosed I send you a Copy of the Confederation, the Eighth article of 
which respects Taxation, and has given me great uneasiness, as I cannot 
see any Justice in the Rule therein laid down, for proportioning the 
several States with the charges of the present war. In the first place, it 
appears to me that one third part of the wealth of the Southern States 
which consists in Negroes, is entirely left out, and no notice taken of them 
in determining their ability to pay taxes, notwithstanding it is by them 
that they procure their wealth ; neither are we to have any advantage of 
them in proportioning the number of men to be drawn from the several 
States to carry on the war, that being fixed on the number of white inhab- 
itants in each State, so that by their negroes being left at home, they can 
till their lands and get bread and riches, while some other States may be 
greatly distressed. In the next place, the wealth that is in some States 
more than there is in others, by no means fixes a proportionable Value on 
the Lands in such States, â€” which, if this be true, seems to prove that the 
plan laid down by Congress is not just : These are my own thoughts on 
this head ; but refer you to your own better judgment on them.^ It seems 
to be the sense of Congress, that if any of the Articles of Confederation, 
should be thought hard of or unequal to any of the States, that they will 
make a representation of the same to Congress, with the reasons of their 
disapprobation to such articles, in order if possible to give satisfaction and 
ease to each and every of the States. The time fixed on for the several 
Legislatures, to determine on these great Points, is by some members 
thought too short ; but I make no doubt but they will take as much time 
to deliberate thereon as may be thought just and necessary.^ .... 

^ This must refer to the committee appointed Nov. 22 on the letter of Nov. 21 
from William Buchanan, commissary-general of purchases, which reported Nov. 24. 
There is further evidence in an omitted paragraph that the latter part of this letter was 
written as late as Nov. 22. A committee of five was appointed Nov. 24, to devise ways 
and means for supplying the army with provisions. 

8 In a letter to Samuel Purviance, jr., Nov. 17, Lee says that he will be passing

leave Congress until Dec. 6. See no. 768, post.

request you will immediately comply with this order. The number of 
men, arms and quantity of Provisions is submitted to your discreation, but 
it is of great Importance that Mr. Willing get speedily down, and that 
he has truely faithful People with him, therefore we flatter ourselves no

2 This letter comes to light just as this material is going into page-proof. On 
the same day the committee wrote to Oliver Pollock in New Orleans : " The present 
[letter] is dispatched by Capt. James Willing by the way of Fort Pitt and will serve to 
inform you that Congress have determined that part of the stores arrived or to arrive 
from Spain at New Orleans for the use of these States shall if possible be brought up 
the Mississippi and Ohio to Fort Pitt." The committee then sets forth its plans, which 
Pollock is asked to carry into effect. (Library of Congress, Papers Cont. Cong., no. 50, 
f. 40.) There is not in the Journals at this time the least intimation of the projected 
expedition to New Orleans to be conducted by Willing, although during the next four 
years various matters incidental to the expedition find record in the Journals. The first 
of these entries is under Jan. 31, 1778, when an account rendered by Willing is laid 
before Congress ; the next is under Feb. 19, when a letter from General Hand was read, 
referring to Congress for determination a matter pertaining to the expedition. A letter 
of Feb. 21 from two members of the commercial committee, Francis Lewis and William 
Ellery, to Robert Morris refers incidentally to the proceedings upon Hand's letter : 
" Messrs. Forbes and Ellery who were the only members of the Commercial Committee 
then present, laid before Congress General Hand's Letter etc. respecting the Rattletrap. 
Some of the Members were dissatisfied with that undertaking and asked a Multitude of 
questions about it. The instructions given to Captain Willing were read, but still they 
wanted more light." (See the next volume of these Letters. The Rattletrap was the 
boat commanded b}' Willing.) The remarks here quoted suggest that the project was 
probably set on foot by the commercial committee on its own initiative and without the 
knowledge of Congress as a body. 

The instructions to Willing have not been found, but they may be gathered from the 
committee's letter to Pollock referred to above. Moreover, in a memorial which he 
presented to Congress Oct. 29, 1781, Willing gives his own account briefly of what his 
instructions were. He sets forth, " That a com^e of Congress kno\\'ing your memorialist 
to be well acquainted with the local state and situation of the british settlements in that 
quarter employed him to proceed from York town to Fort Pitt there to equip and arm 
a batteau with twenty-four men the command of which was given to him with a captains 
commission and orders to proceed with dispatches to the Governor of New Orleans and 
to Mr. Oliver Pollock agent at that place on behalf of the United States. In order to 
receive and convoy from New Orleans up the Mississippi and Ohio to Fort Pitt certain 
stores which had been deposited for the use of the American army and Navy and also 
instructions to capture whatever british property he might meet with in the said rivers."

Honourable Gentlemen 

Your Dispatches of the 22(1 of October were safely deliver'd by the 
Express. I thou^t^ht it adviseahle. Mr Duer being absent a few days for 
the Benefit of Health, to detain him till Congress shou'd have time to de- 
liberate and determine upon the delicate and important Propositions you 
recommend to their Attention. They are now submitted to a Committee 
and you shall be acquainted with the Result.^ 

Every body here is sensibly touched at the melancholy catastophre 
which followd the Loss of the Passes in the high Lands.* When so great 
a number of Troops were withdrawn I predicted the fatal Event. In 
calling away 1500 men Congress in my opinion went too far. I strenu- 
ously remonstrated against it ; but in Vain. The Hopes of being able to 
subdue General Howe by such a Reinforcement preponderated : no body 
[nor] any member coud be Perswaded that it was in Sir Henry Clinton's 
power to give the State of New York the least disturbance. The Report 
of his having receivd Reinforcements was not credited. The unhappy 

He relates further, " that altho a superior force of the enemy prevented his return up 
the rivers yet his operations in that quarter created a considerable diversion by drawing 
off a part of the enemys force from their main army and employing a number of armed 
vessels to protect the navigation of the Mississippi ". Finally, he relates that he embarked 
from New Orleans for Philadelphia Nov. 15, 1778, with despatches from the governor 
to Congress but was taken and carried to New York," where he endured a long a cruel and 
expensive imprisonment". (Papers Cont. Cong., no. 42, VIII. 237.) Accounts of 
Willing's operations on the lower Mississippi indicate that the diversion which he created 
was chiefly an indulgence in plundering forays. See especially Claiborne, Mississippi, ch. 
XV.; Gayarre, History of Louisiana, III. iog-114; and Winsor, Westward Movement, 
pp. 156-158. Some account of Willing's invasion is related in a letter of Gov. Peter 
Chester to Maj.-Gen. Augustine Prevost, Mar. 21, 1778, in British Historical Manuscripts 
Commission, Report on American Manuscripts in the Royal Institution, 1. 213. (See 
also ibid., pp. 197, 236.) In the George Rogers Clark Papers (ed. J. A. James) are two 
letters from Willing to Clark, writen from New Orleans Aug. 22 and Sept. i, 1778, 
besides some other materials relating to the expedition. Some letters of Willing are in

however a postscript dated Nov. 22. In a passage of this letter here omitted Duane 
says : " The confederation is completed and I expect will be forwarded by this convey- 
ance, as it is in the press at Lancaster." According to Daniel Roberdeau, Nov. 16 (see 
no. 746, note 4, ante), the Confederation had not then been sent to Lancaster. Duane also 
speaks of a report prevailing that Fort Mifflin had already been evacuated. _ The 
Pennsylvania Evening Post of Nov. 17 carried an announcement of the evacuation on 
Saturday, Nov. 15. The absence of Duer, which Duane mentions, must have been from 
about Nov. 9 (see his letter of that date. no. 73"^, ante) to about Nov. 19. as his name 
does not appear in the Journals between those dates.

My dear Sir, 

.... The confederation is not yet returned from press but we expect 
it will in a day or two when it will be sent forward, and with it will come 
this letter. We have strongly pressed the speedy consideration and return- 
of the Confederation,'^ and we have urged the necessity of immediate and 
extensive Taxation, regulation of prices, and other Measures of finance, 
oeconomy, and effectual recruiting the army.' I know my friend Mr. 
John Adams will say the regulation of prices wont do. I agree it will not 
singly answer, and I know that Taxation with Oeconomy are the radical 
cures. But I also know that the best Physicians sometimes attend to 
Symptoms, apply palliatives and under favor of the Truce thus obtained, 
introduce cause removing medicines. Let us for a moment check the 
enormity of the evil by this method, whilst the other more sure, but more 
slow methods secure us against a return of the mischief. The middle and

having refused to join in the plan formerly, rendered the experiment on 
your part inconclusive and partial; therefore I do not think Mr. Adams's 
argument drawn from that trial quite decisive against the Measure. I 
incline to think that the necessity of the case will now procure its adoption 
universally, and then we shall see what great things may be effected by 
common consent. The American conduct has already shattered and 
overset the conclusions of the best Theorists, and I hope this will be 
another instance. 

Two days ago I moved the immediate recall of Mr. Deane, which was 
agreed without dissent,* and tomorrow is appointed for choosing a Com- 
missioner in his place. Our friends Mr. John Adams and Mr. Denny ' 
are in Nomination, with some others. This appointment was strongly 
pressed on me in Congress,Â® but my dear friend, rigid as you are in these 
matters, I am sure you would have admitted my apology. I feel the 
obligations of public duty very powerfully, but when these duties can be 
better discharged by others, why may not the private ones be suffered to 
prevail ? Why may not chari liberi have their weight, when such a sacri- 
fice is not necessary for the public service. I remember that in some 
points our opinion differed respecting Mr. Deane, but I feel myself obliged 
to think that he has pursued his best judgement for the good of his 
Country when he made those distressing contracts, and perhaps his 
peculiar situation compelled him to carry tnem further than he might 
otherwise have done. Be this as it may, after Congress had so strongly 
determined concer[n]ing these, it would have been out of all character 
to have continued him.'' Yet this is a matter of great delicacy and I am 
not well satisfied with the whole of it. If our friend Mr. Adams should 
be chosen, I have earnest hopes that he will accept. The loss of time 
that will attend his refusal, independant of other considerations, renders 
it of much consequence that he should not refuse

the States in a few days, with strong exortation to consider and return

other, and not rigidly insist on having everything correspondent to the 
partial views of every State. On such terms we can never confederate.

means a just criterion to fix the relative riches of States. Of old times

Holland and Poland â€” England and Germany. But the truth is that let 
wealth How into a Country from whatever cause, it will forever reflect 
value upon the lands of that Country, and they rise in value in proportion 
to the influx of wealth. Thus the value of lands in England has doubled 
and trepled as commerce has brought wealth into the Island. For my own 
part, I doubt extremely whether Virginia will not pay more by the 
pres[e]nt Mode than if it had been determined by numbers. But I am 
satisfied that the mode now fixt is the most just, and so fiat justicia, mat

America cannot be free and happy. You was unanimously appointed, 
and from the Experience wch. Gentlemen have had since you left the

Acceptance. I know not your Sentiments on the Matter, but Iiowever 
they may be, I most ardently wish that You may accept of this appoint- 
ment for many Reasons. Colo Reed was nominated and would have 
been apix:Â»inted, had it not been known to Gentlemen that your Situation 
with respect to each would not admit of your sitting together at the same 
Board.* I think there is not the least Doubt of this Fact. Your own 
affairs need not interrupt your immediate Attendance, as the Super 
Intendance of all the Commissaries in the eastern and northern Depart- 
ment is with the Governor and Council of Connecticut, who may displace 
and appoint at pleasure, and can direct the issuing Commissaries to 
receive the provision now on your Hands, and your Accounts may be 
settled witho. a constant attendance on the Commissioners. 

the succession of Errors wch have taken place in the Commissary's 
Department, have reverberated on Congress, and had the Gentlemen Who 
were the Cause thereof been troubled with an attention to the Business of 
rectifying them, I should not have regretted the Consequences, but this 
Burthen has unreasonably fell on those who opposed the Errors from the 
Beginning, and there seems to be a general Conviction that the Business 
never will be carried on by some of the present Officers.^ .... 

I hope soon to see the Treasury Office upon a new Establishment,^ and 
that your Brother the p. M General will be a Commissioner; his Salary is 
augmented to 125 Dollars per Month, but I think him too valuable for 
that office, altho it must be acknowledged an important one/ .... 

P. S. If you decline this office, it must have all the Effects so far as 
it respects yourself of giving up the Cause ; a Measure that my Friend 
will never consent to, after having endured greater Toils than may be 
expected in future.

I much dislike the new Regulations of the Comissa. Department, but 
had no doubt Alterations wo"^ take place, as they have already and very

The Congress finding almost every department in the Army running 
into the greatest Confusion and disorder for want, as we apprehend of 
a proper Board Consisting of Gentn. well skill'd in the various depart- 
ments and who can at least for some time Constantly attend to the im- 
mediate concerns of the Army and our board of Warr hitherto Consisting 
of Members of Congress who could not be supposed to have a proper 
knowledge of the several departments, and beside had not time to attend 
to them Congress have Unanimously agreed to Constitute that Important 
Board, and to have it consist of such Gentn. whom they think have the 
greatest knowledge of the several departments and abilities to discern 
and discover from whence the disorders arise and how they may be 
remedied, have therefore made Choice of Ma jr. Genii Gates Majr. Genii 
Mifflin, Coll. Pickering present Adjutant Genii. Mr Trumbull late Com- 
missy. Genii, and Mr Peters, who has heretofore been Secretary of the 
Board of Warr to Constitute that Board, Genii. Gates to be President 
and who is also to be Continued Majr. Genii, and to act as such in the 
Army as Occasion may require, the Salary is at present established at 
2000 dollars Pr Annum, some were for 3000. and not quite a Majority 
for 2500, but considering the times, and in hopes and expectation that our 
Currency will soon regain its Credit it was thought best not for an 
Establishment to exceed 2000, and had better if Necessary some other 
way make an allowance for extraordinary expences to the present board, 
than make an Establishment at this time tho' just could not afterwards 
be reduced if our money in a great measure regained its Credit, and 
believe tho not certain that Congress will generously consider the present 
board over and above the present Establishment, as to your Appoint- 
ment as One, it was without any Sollicitation of those you might call 
your Friends or any movements from them, but by the Unanimous 
Choice not only of every State but of ever}^ Individual member of Con- 
gress and every State except Jersey and Deleware not represented, 
therefore I hope notwithstanding your past feelings, your present Interest 
and Inclination to tarry at home, and retire among the common Mass of 
private Citizens ; Yet that you have not so lost your strong attachment to 
your Country, their Interest and defence as to refuse them your Assis-

very valuable, they were for settling the quota by the number of Inhabi-

Congress ever watchful over the Interests of the United States of 
America and diligent to defeat the numerous and various practices of our 
grand Enemy equally cruel and subtle have taken under consideration a 
device calculated for depreciating the Value of the Paper Money issued 
by authority of Congress and of the several States after the good People 
had found it necessary to assert their Rights and to take Government into 
their own hands, the pernicious Stratagem now in view, although the 
discovery of it is not quite new appears more glaring from a late Publi- 
cation in Philadelphia subscribed by a very great number of those mis- 
guided persons who chose to remain in the City and welcome the Enemy 
to rivet their fetters.^ 

It is also notorious that many timid and lukewann friends in several of 
the States have, from motives probably more avaricious than Inimical, 
long given a great preference to what is called the old Money, which 
evidently tends to lessen the Estimation and Currency of the New and 
does in the same Instance demonstrate, if not an Inclination to overturn

Dear Sir 

The day after you left York, I moved Congress for an order in the 
following words. " Whereas it is of the greatest Importance that Con- 
gress should, at this critical conjuncture be well informed of the State of 
affairs in Europe, and whereas Congress have resolved that the Honble. 
Silas Deane Esqr. be recalled from the court of France and have 
appointed another Commissioner to supply his place there. 

Ordered That the Committee for foreign affairs write to the honble. 
Silas Deane, and direct him to embrace the ftrst opportunity of returning 
to America and upon his arrival to repair with all possible dispatch to Con- 
gress. ["]^

See nos. 753, 760, 766, ante. Lee himself says that he left Congress Dec. 6 (Letters, 
I. 381). He was evidently in Congress as late as Dec. 4, for a letter of that date from 
the committee of foreign affairs to Deane transmitting the order of recall is signed by Lee 
and Lovell (Wharton, Rev. Dipl. Corr., IL 444) . Lee was also appointed on a committee 
on that day. Cf. no. 748, note 8, ante. Lovell's letter to John Adams, Dec. 8 (no. 769, 
post), does not suggest that the motion was made earlier than the 8th.

" By accident I find myself called upon singly to execute the duty of the

date it; and, being drawn in terms complimentary to your abilities of 
serving these United States upon your arrival here, I take pleasure in 
conveying it, being Sir, your very humb. Servt." ' 

I hope, Dear Sir, you will consider this proceeding as giving some sort 
of definition to the Recall, and in moderate language ; as it stood before, 
he was to be recalled, but the time when was not in any measure marked

attended to. The calling in your paper Currency, especially that issued 
under the Authority of the British Government (as a distinction is made 
by the Tories and sordid Whigs already of at least 100 per cent, which in 
its consequences must ruin our public Credit) ought to command the 
attention of our Legislature.^ .... 

We are daily entertained by Members of Congress, with paragraphs

You will be pleased first to observe that Congress knows no more of 
the intentions of the Army than you do, until some event or other takes

I hope the Assembly will open your Courts for the recovery of Debts, 
That you will immediately begin to lay Taxes as other states have done, 
that you will call in all the Currency emitted under the authority of the 
King of G. Britain etc. these are matters of the utmost Consequence, and 
Strenuously recommended by Congress to the several states. Our very

White Marsh Deer. loth. 1777 

In Consequence of the conferences we have had with your Excellency, 
and knowing yours and your General Officers opinions on the subject of 
our Mission, we have come to the resolution's contained in the enclosed 
paper, finding them as far as we can judge most consistant with the 
Public good. 

Among the many reasons offered against a Winters Campaigne we 
were sorry to observe one of the most prevalent was a general discontent 
in the Army and especially among the Officers. These discontents are 
ascribed to various causes and we doubt not many of them are well 
founded and deserve particular attention, and in the course of the present 
Winter, will be taken into consideration by Congress, and we hope effec- 
tually remedied. 

That a reform may take place in the Army, and proper discipline be 
introduced, We wish to see the Military placed on such a footing as may 
make a Commission a desirable object to the Officer, and his Rank pre- 
served from degradation and contempt; for these purposes we intend to 
recommend to Congress 

That an half pay establishment be formed and adopted in the Amer- 
ican Service 
That a pensionary establishment take place in favour of Officers 

Widows. 
That a new regulation of Rank confining it as far as possible to the 

line of the Army be adopted. 
That an equitable mode of paying for hack ration be ordered. 
Should these several regulations be approved and established by Con- 
gress (and we have reason to suppose they will) We trust the prevailing 
discontents will subside and a spirit of emulation take place among the 
Gentlemen of the Army to promote the Public Service and introduce that 
order and discipline amongst the Troops so essential to the Military 
character. 

As a further inducement the Committee have it also in contemplation 
to propose in Congress that the Officers be permitted to dispose of their

Gentlemen 

In the Character of a Delegate in Congress give me leave to address 
you. Your President has been confined to his Chamber and in Bed for 
three days and Nights past during which time he has not had three hours 
Sleep, the Malady under which he labours has made such a progress as 
to convince him by reflecting upon former attacks that he will not be able 
to move out of the House nor to attend his duty in Congress for some 
Weeks to come. When he accepted the Honour which you were pleased 
to confer on him it was with a single Eye to your service in the most 
comprehensive meaning. Now he finds himself incapable of performing 
his duty he is anxious to Resign that Honour, which he accepted only in 
obedience to your Vote." 

These, you may depend upon it Gentlemen, are the genuine sentiments 
of his mind. 

There already lies upon his Table much business which with pain he 
thinks of, because it is not in his power to give proper dispatch to it. 
every day unless you are pleased to prevent it, will accumulate the heap 
public business will be impeded and some branches will run into Con- 
fusion. 

I therefore humbly move you Gentlemen to proceed to the choice of a 
President as an act of propriety and necessity, be assured I should have 
continued to serve you with diligence and fidelity if my health had per- 
mitted. I trust I shall not only be seconded in this Motion but that there 
will not be a dissenting voice in Congress. 
I am Gentlemen

York-Town State of Pennsylvania 

Deer. 14th. 1777 
Sir, 

.... Congress have determined upon the mode of Inquiry into the 
causes of the failure of the Rhode-Island Expedition, and have appointed 
Genl. Whipple, of N Hampshire, Robert Treat Paine, Esq. of Massachu- 
setts-Bay, H. Marchant, Esq., of Rhode-Island, Oliver Elsworth, Esq., 
of Connecticut, and Egbert Benson, Esq., of New- York Commissioners 
for that purpose : the Time of their meeting to be the first monday in 
february, and the place Providence.^ 

The Question hath been asked side ways, who is to pay the Expense of 
that Expedition ; but it hath not yet been serious asked and I hope it will 
not. If the Expedition had succeeded we should never have heard about 
the Expense, and perhaps if tlie Authors of its failure are brought to 
Light, their Punishment may appease the Resentment of Congress, and 
obliterate the Idea of an enormous useless Expense.Â® We have no late 
news from France or the W. Indies. When anything occurs of Conse- 
quence, I shall write to your Excellency, in the mean Time give me leave 
to subscribe myself, with great Regard, Yr Excellency's 

most obedt humble Servant, 

William Ellery 

Deer. 17th. 
[P. S.] . . . . Since I wrote the foregoing, Genl. Washington trans- 
mitted to Congress a letter from Genl. Heath to him, in which he in- 
formed G. W. that Application had been made to him by the Offi[ce]rs 
concerned in the Rhode Island expedition for their pay, and desired to 
know whether the Continent or the States who fu[r]nished the Troops 
were to pay the expence. This brot in the question which I hoped would 
never have been started, and after a slight agitation, in which I perceived it 
was the Sense of Congress that the Continent ought to bear the Expence, it 
was referred to a Committee to examine the Journals in this Regard, and 
to report to Congress

Regular way Conj^ress have done every thing in tlicir power to reheve 
you, the fault lias lain entirely with Coll Stewart in not taking care of his 
Department they have repeatedly wrote him or directed Mr. Buchanan 
to Inform him of the dificultics which lie in his department where he is 
and what is become of him we know not, we have heard that he had set 
out for the Eastern world some time agoe but to prevent every dificulty 
for the future thev have Imjwwered Govr. Trumbull to supply every 
defect in both the purchasing and Issuing Department in that part of the 
world.-" Orders have been' long Given to Mr. Buchanan for 2 hund. 
thousand dollars on the loan office in Boston for the Eastern Department 
to be paid in preference to any other (as by the return made from that 
office they were good for more than that sum) and to be Immediately 
sent to Mr. Colt, and to save and Indemnifye you the Treasury Board 
have rendered Valid, and to pass to your account all the stores any Genii 
officer shall either take or that you may deliver to their Order.* I hope 
before this you are in a great measure relieved of your dificulties You 
Inform me that you were about to set out for Boston and Salem to pur- 
chase Cloathing for the Colony and had it not been for Coll. Williams' 
letter* Informing you of the jealousies and Suspicions Congress had 
entertained of your Integrity etc you was about to undertake to supply 
with provisions from Connecticut but on his Information you declined 
having anything to do with it and was so advised by the Govr and his 
Council I should have thot that both the Govr and you had been long 
enough acquainted with Coll. Williams I mean the suddeness of his 
Temper the warmth of his Imagination, the strong Impression sometimes 
a little matter makes on his mind, (tho' of an honest good heart) to lay so 
great a Stress upon his painting. I found he had wrote and feard as for 
some other of his letters They were unguarded and would have no good 
effect but the Contrary*, he informed me the ground of his letter was 
when some affairs touching the Commissy department were agitated in 
Congress a Certain Member he would not tell me who not knowing as he 
supposes of his Connection with you whispered him that he feard you 
was so put out and Chagrined at the New Regulations that you had in 
some measure embarrassed and discouraged others in undertaking I have 
no doubt but somebody might throw out such a hint to him, and possibly 
some might have such fears or suspicion; but is that enough to lay so 
great a Stress upon, when you have been repeatedly assured that Con- 
gress in general and believe may say now Universally entertain a high 
opinion of your Abilities and Integrity in your whole Conduct in that De- 
partment, they have given you the Strongest Evidence of it by a Unani- 
mous unsolicited Vote even of every Individual in appointing you one of 
a Board, the most honourable as well as Interesting to your Country.'

your long defence and Exculpation in your letter to Congress against 
Charges they had never heard nor believe suspected and was equally sorry 
to hear the Governors letter Complaining of the Treatment his sons had 
received especially at this time, when I can assure him and you that both 
you and your brother the Paymaster Stand in a fairer point of light with 
Congress than any two Gentn. ever employ'd by them, yet I am Sensi- 
ble that at a time, to serve some friend or particular purpose your brother 
was Superseded and you have had now and then a Squib thrown at you 
but without making any impression prejudicial to your Carracter. your 
brother John was ill treated I believe but all would have been put right 
had he been a little more soft in his letter old Doctor Witherspoon of 
high Scotch feeling was nettled and without any prejudice against the 
family principally opposed its being rectified.Â® You say it is a little won- 
derd at my and Coll Williams Recommendation of a Certain Gentn.'' I 
did it from political motives, which can explain to you when I may have 
the pleasure of seeing you again, which hope will be soon. Congress 
have great hopes and expectations from this New Constituted Board of 
Warr. the Army in every Department wants a total reform and regula- 
tion both Internal and External we are determined by the blessing of 
Heaven to have it Effected, our appointment meets with universal ap- 
plause, great Expectations are from it. We have also appointed Inspec- 
tors Genii, of the Army in every department, who will be Executors and 
assist, agts to the board of Warr. will Inspect make their returns and 
reports to you. they are Gentn. of great knowledge abilities and Integrity 
and believe will be Intent to reform abuses regulate disorders establish 
discipline in the Army, since the above received yours from Boston of 
the 7th. what is past cannot be helpd. we must make the best of what is 
to come, it is unaccountable what is become of Mr. Colts order for 2 hund 
thousand dollars, a duplicate is now sent and a large sum in Cash, the 
order on New York reversed and an order to Govr and Council of Safety 
on Connecticut Loan office in Lieu of it, which we find now to be good 
for a Considerable sum.* Congress have had every department to 
attend to, hope it is in a good way at last the Gov. and Councill may 
Employe Coll Champion and whom they please, assist Mr. Colt Cooperate 
one with another as much as possible I know they dont want the trouble, 
but the Mistakes in past will require greater Exertions in the future Our 
Army have done so much fighting this summer they seem much Inclined 
to go into winter quarters and prepare for spring, if so How will have 
free plunder possibly disturb them in their proposed quiet.

General Stark's Answer as soon as possible : If you can form any prob- 
able Conjecture when it may be expected your Opinion will regulate my 
Conduct 

I hope to have the Pleasure of an Interview with you before you pro-

This clay the memorial from our State concerning the cantonment of 
the regular army was taken into consideration. Congress had some time 
ago, by a Committee, recommended to Genl Washington, if he determined 
to take winter quarters, to dispose of his army in such manner as would 
most cfTectually cover the Country, etc. They have now ordered the 
memorial of our State to be transmitted to the Genl, and liave desired him 
to inform Congress whether he is about to canton his troops, and where, 
and what provision he has made for securing the East side of Schuylkill 
and the State of N. Jersey. This you will be pleased to communicate to 
the Gentlemen of both houses for their present satisfaction. A copy of 
the resolution I have not time by this opportunity to forward, but suppose 
it will be sent more formally by our delegates by the next opportunity 
that may offer.^ 

We hear that the army are about putting in the Gulph valley. This 
is the wish of Congress as far as I can judge.

Appearances sprang from the Conduct of our own People and certain 
Necessities, but not from any Breach of the Convention by the Will of 
Genl. Burgoyne or his Officers 

You have doubtless e'er this been made acquainted with G : Burgoyne's 
critical Disposition in regard to the descriptive List of his men which was 
to have been taken by Genl. Heath's order. For this and other similar 
Pride it was thought proper to take hold of Mr. Bourgoyne's manner of 
asking a Favour of Congress thro one of its Officers : In consequence, the 
following Resolve was passed the 17th. Resolved that Genl. Washington 
be directed to inform Genl. Burgoyne the Congress will not receive nor 
consider any Proposition for Indulgence or altering the terms of the Con- 
vention of Saratoga unless immediately directed to their own Body. 

With a Degree of the Arts of our Enemies this Resolve is penned to 
lead Burgoyne into direct Petition to Congress, tho it does not give an 
absolute Promise to grant his Petition.^ 

You will find in some of my attendant slovenly scrawls so much encour- 
agement to expect from me Intelligence about our grand Army upon the 
Return of the Committee, that I do not know how to avoid saying some- 
thing about it, now, though 'tis a Subject very sickening to even a strong 
Stomach. 

The Majority of the Officers were fixt and determined against a 
Winter-Campaign; and the Nakedness of the Soldiers furnished such 
abundant Argument to their Leaders that the Committee could not recom- 
mend any thing better than a Cantonment which would best tend to cover 
the Countrey and accomodate the army. 

It was evident, among Friends I say it, that our Army was not inclined 
to fight Howe when he gave them 4 days opportunity. The Committee 
therefore could not give it as their Opinion to the General that he ought, 
with that same Army, to force the Lines of the Enemy, or attempt the 
City by the Schuylkill. In short, unless we secure Half pay to Officers 
and Pensions to their Widows and make their Commissions vendible, 
severe Discipline in respect to Officers cannot be introduced, and conse- 
quently none at all in respect to Soldiers. But the General does swear 
that, if the Commissions are made desirable, he will cashier without 
favour or affection till the Army becomes vigorous: In this hope we 
breathe this day ; but verily my own Share of Hope is not great enough

My Lord, 

We have been much alarmed by a report that the Army was going into 
Winter quarters in or about Wilmington, thereby leaving New Jersey 
and a great part of Penns^ intirely open to the Enemy, This Supposed 
measure produced several Resolutions of Congress, which, with a Re- 
monstrance on that Subject from the Legislature of Penns* are forwarded 
to the Commander in Chief, requesting his particular Attention to the 
Security of New Jersey etc. We had before Congress the Opinions of 
the General officers respecting proper places for Cantoning the Army, and 
with great pleasure find you in favour of the Valley near Schuylkill, 
which in the judgment of all or most I have met with is the only place 
for defending the Country and preventing Supplies to the Enemy, as the 
Army at Wilmington would leave great part of Penns^ and Jersey 
greatly exposed to the Enemys Ravages, the Shiping up Delaware would 
be lost, and all the extensive Salt works in Jersey destroyed, and not un- 
likely a general defection take place in this State, and many parts of 
Jersey, and Supplies for the Army from the Eastern States greatly 
Obstructed.^. . . .

Sir, 

I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed duplicate of a letter which I had 
the honour of writing to you the 23d Inst transmitted by the hand of a 
Mr. Storer.^ 

Congress having received from Gen. Gates as intimated in my last, 
Copy of a Letter written to him by Lieut* Gen. Burgoyne in which this 
Gentleman declares that " the public faith is broke " etc., have taken his 
declaration, together with his refusal, under an assertion not founded in 
truth, to give such descriptive marks of his Non Commissioned Officers 
privates and other persons as you had demanded, into their most serious 
consideration in a Committee of the wdiole House, these weighty and 
important circumstances after having long employed the close attention 
of a select Committee, have taken up almost the whole time of Congress 
for two days past, nor have the House yet accomplished all the solemn 
and necessar}' Resolutions which the Case demands but so far has the 
House proceeded as to receive a Report from the Committee of the whole, 
and to order me to address you Sir, in terms of the Letter which you will 
find inclosed and of this which I am now^ penning, these will be followed 

2 Two letters from Washington, Dec. 22 and 23 (Writings, ed. Ford, VI. 252, 
257), describing conditions in the army, were read in Congress Dec. 26 and referred to 
a committee. December 29 this committee was discharged, and the letters referred to 
the board of war and three additional members as a committee. See nos. 794, 795, post,

as speedily as possible by extended Acts and Resolutions prepared for 
your further direction and for public Information on both sides the 
Atlantic.^ 

It is the express desire and injunction of Congress that you do not 
communicate the contents of these Letters to any person until it shall 
become absolutely necessary, that is to say until you shall have received 
the intended Acts and Resolves or until you shall have attempted and 
if possible completed certain essential Acts, admitting the Vessels for 
transporting Lt. Gen. Burgoyne and his Troops to be arrived at the port 
of Boston, by essential Acts, Congress mean that the Tonnage of the 
Transport Vessels and also that the Stores of Provisions and Fuel should 
be particularly enquired into and ascertained to be in your judgement 
sufficient for transportation and sustenance of the numbers of persons 
intended to be embarked for a Voyage from Boston to Great Britain, 
and more particularly that all accounts be liquidated and the Amount due 
by Lt. Gen. Burgoyne or as great a part of it as you can obtain, actually 
paid in Gold or Silver according to the rate specified in the Resolve of 
Congress of the 19th Inst, transmitted in my last Letter, in order to 
reduce within the smallest compass articles which hereafter may be made 
subjects for cavil and disputation by the Court of Great Britain on whose 
honour and justice these States cannot at present with any degree of 
safety rely. 

These Acts which Congress judge indespensibly necessary to be per- 
formed before an embarkation can take place will employ some days and 
gain so much time without subjecting the Honour of the House or of its 
Constituents to any unfavourable imputation from the world. You will 
also from what has been said perceive good ground for renewing your 
demand of the Names and particular description of the Non Commis- 
sioned Officers privates etc. but it may be prudent not to press this unless 
by appeal to expected directions from Congress and to the conduct of 
Sir Guy Carleton in the Instance adduced by Mr. Burgoyne and permit 
him if he pleases to decoy himself. 

If when you shall have sufficiently attempted or completed these neces- 
sary Acts you shall not have received the intended Resolves of Congress, 
it will then be necessary for you to disclose the Contents of the Inclosed 
Letter to General Burgoyne and peremptorily to prohibit his embarka- 
tion until you shall have received further directions on that point. 

You Avill understand the motive for dating that Letter January 1778, 
and leaving a Blank for the day to be properly and carefully filled by your 
self.* 

I have in conclusion to assure you Sir. that Congress repose the highest 
confidence in your address and abilities for conducting with propriety this 
very important business in which on one side the faith and honour of 
these Infant States are to be preserved, and on the other the magnanimity

Mr Batwell, on an application to be enlarged on security on his parole, 
accompanied with a certificate from his Physician, that fresh air and 
exercise were absolutely necessary to his recovery, obtained the following 
resolution : 

" That in the opinion of Congress the Revd Mr Batwell should be 
discharged out of confinement on his taking an oath of allegiance to the 
State of Pennsilvania, or on his refusal that he should be allowed to go 
with his family into the City of Philadelphia" The delicacy of interfering 
with this State w^as agitated, together with the very low condition of the 
petitioner whose life was reported to be in iminent danger, and might add 
to the number of marters in the esteem of the disaffected, who interested 
themselves in his behalf, nevertheless the prayer of the petition was not 
attended to, but the above alternative given, for Congress did not know 
how, otherwise, to get rid of importunity, and apprehended this Step 
from all circumstances, would not be disagreeable to the State.^ I think 
the above resolve is a specimen of treatment Congress w^ould wish to 
other disaffected persons in every State, as was at large said in debate, 
with much concern that decisive measures had not long since been taken 
with all Enemies to the Independence of America. A Committee are 
appointed to take into consideration the deplorable condition of our army, 
and to report to-morrow.^ I make no doubt that the most vigorous 
measures will be recommended to be immediately taken, as without, the 
army must disperse as mentioned in my last. ]My situation is extremely 
delicate on this occasion ; the ruin of our Army, or the interference with 
the police of the State, I apprehend will be the alternative set before me ; 
under these circumstances I should be glad of advice and assistance. The 
House of Burgesses, in Virginia, have unanimously consented to the con- 
fideration. as handed to them with orders to their Delegates, to confirm 
it on the loth March.

I am now sitting both feet and Legs bouiid up in a Blanket in the room 
where Congress meets, between the adjournment at -\ p : one oClock and 
meeting hour at 3, and where a scrap of some what will be sent for my 
repast to serve till tomorrow's breakfast, perhaps two, it may be three, 
hours after dark I may be permitted to hobble on my Crutches over Ice 
and frozen Snow or to be carried to such a homely home as I have, where 
I must set in Bed one or two or three hours longer at the writing Table, 
pass the remainder of a tedious night in pain and some anxiety, I hear 
you reply â€” why fait[h] if I was you I would resign the president ship, 
believe me my dear Sir that was my solid determination on the 2d. or 3d. 
day after my present troublesome companion had taken possession of 
me, when by reflection comparison with former attacks and making a 
proper allowance for the rigor of this Climate I foresaw a continuance of 
pain and Crippleism for many Weeks. I then dictated a Letter to be 
written to Congress expressing my apprehensions and earnestly intreating 
an acceptance of my resignation.^ an answer was returned by a Member, 
that Congress were not disposed to grant my request but would in 
preference to appointing a new President, address the Chair and Secre- 
tary during my unavoidable absence, this seemed and indeed was very 
kind and a little flattering â€” a Compliment which laid claim to my grati- 
tude. I summoned patience and fortitude to my Aid, I adopted every 
measure I could think of in order to restore me to strength and abstained 
from everything, except hard work, that could have the smallest tendency 
to impede my recovery, writing in Bed, and especially one particular 
Nights discipline when I kept the Pen in hand till one in the Morning 
and resumed it again before five, shook me. however on Christmas day 
I found myself so far relieved from severe paine as to encourage hopes 
that three or four days indulgence would produce a little Strength in my 
Ankles, but late that Evening and again very early next Morning I re- 
ceived visits from a Zealous Member of Congress pressing me if possible 
by any means, to attend the House the 26th. adding, the request was made 
by desire of many Members not so immediately to the President as to a 
Member who solely represented a State, intimating that the business which 
I had set or encouraged to set in motion of the highest importance was to

would not have been felt, if it had been directed to the president. I know

Civilized World, possibly I may find my self at liberty to be more ex- 
plicit to His Excellency the President â€” but to return, the summon ani- 
mated my Soul, which is more vigorous in my present condition than 
the Body â€” " South Carolina shall not be quite unrepresented I will be 
carried into Congress." I was carried, â€” two whole days trenching deep 
upon each Night were passed in a Committee of the whole, late last 
Saturday Night the business was so far matured as to enable me to dis- 
patch a special Messenger immediately to Major General Heath at Bos- 
ton.^ these exertions have thrown me back I cannot tell how far, but I 
am in a condition which would meet more compassion were you present 
from you than it seems to do from my self. I attend Congress from the 
motive premised and while I can bear to be carried and to sit here, my 
State shall not be totally Absent, the great business is not yet completed 
on our part. God only knows wdiat will be the final end of it. 

I have laboured hard very hard to advance it to its present State, con- 
scious that I am doing eminent service to my country, if my Country 
Men shall be of opinion with a few in this House who appear to me to be 
timerous dunces, I shall be very unhappy, but I shall ever enjoy that 
satisfaction which attends good designs, whether it shall be determined 
by the World to be good or bad, the Act is great and great good or Evil 
will follow as its consequences. 

there are other matters of very momentous concern on the tapis which 
duty requires me to attend to, without reg-arding my own Ease and being 
here since 'tis the desire of Congress, I may as well sit president as any 
other Character, a good seat near a warm fire must compensate for 
additional labour

A whole Month has rolled over since I threw my thoughts upon the 
preceeding pages. I have just passed my Eye over them again and 
determined imperfect as they are to submit them to your candor. I could 
add a long and affecting paragraph on the Subject of Non Representa- 
tion. I could tell you truly, the House has been reduced to nine States 
represented in Units â€” that we have sometimes been stagnant from a 
want of ]Members â€” and oftener running whole days into weeks of un- 
matured conversations from a want of able Members

War Office Deer. 30th 1777 

Sir, 

Congress have received such unexpected and distressing- Acounts from 
the General relative to the Situation of the Army that they have appointed 
a Committee to fall upon immediate Methods for supplying- them with 
Provisions. They are so much in Want of an instant Supply owing to 
Delays and Embarassments in the Commissary's Department and other 
unexpected Causes that however plenty we shall have them in future, at 
present at least a Removal out of this State must be the immediate Conse- 
quence of even a short Continuance of their present Circumstances. An 
instant Supply must be procured from this State for the Support of the 
Army until the Supplies expected from the neighbouring States arrive. 
As it may give Umbrage to the Inhabitants the Committee deplore the 
Necessity they are under of sending Officers with Parties to collect such 
Cattle, Flour and Grain as the Army wants without the least Delay as the 
Crisis is too alarming to admit of the Business being postponed on any 
Consideration. It will be improper to communicate the real Situation of 
the Army, but with the utmost Prudence and Caution. Your Excellency 
will therefore judge in what Manner the Concurrence of this State is to 
be procured as their vigorous Exertions are necessary in Co-operation 
with those of the Comittee who will at least 'till they see the Business 
properly conducted as doubtless it will be by the Government of this State 
be obliged to give orders for the taking conveying and driving all Cattle, 
Hogs, Pork, Flour and Grain fit for their Consumption to the Army the 
Persons employed for this Purpose giving Certificates to the owners 
expressing as nearly as possible the Weight and Quality of them and 
agreeing to pay for them at such Prices as shall be settled by the Conven- 
tion of Comittees from the several States who are to meet at New^ Haven 
the 15th of Jany. next agreeable to a Resolution of Congress of the 226. 
Novr last. 

I have the Honour to be ' 

With great Respect, 

Your very obed Servt 

Francis Lightfoot Lee, 

for the Committee." 

[P. S.] The Committee request you will be pleased to inform them 
whether the Proclamation ordering the Inhabitants of York and Cum- 
berland Counties to thresh out their Grain has been issued.

War Office Deer. 31st 1777 
Sir, 

Cong^ress have received the most alarminp^ Accounts from General 
Washing-ton of the Distress of the Army for Want of Provisions 

A Comittee is appointed by Congress to take efifectual Means for 
preventing so fatal a Blow as the Dispersion or Dissolution of our Army 
would be to our Liberties. They have been obliged from the Necessity 
of the Case to g-ive Orders for siezing all the Provisions in the Vicinity 
of the Camp in this State which will afford a small but temporary Supply. 
They have written to the adjacent States and earnestly besought their 
immediate Assistance. Much Dependance is placed in your Exertions at 
this important Crisis and the Comittee need but state the Facts to induce 
you immediately to take measures for the remedying the Evil. I beg 
Leave to sug-gest to you whether an immediate Seisure of all Cattle, Hogs, 
Pork and Salt in the State of Maryland is not indispensibly necessary and 
Certificates given payable by Congress to the Possessors. You are the 
best Judge of proper Measures to be taken within your State and therefore 
the Comittee will not trouble you with their Ideas of the Plan to be 
executed for procuring the Articles wanted. They are confident you will 
be as speedy as the Nature of the Case will admitt convinced that im- 
mediate Supplies can only be had from the nearest States and the Comittee 
have taken Steps for obtaining Relief in future from those more remote.^ 

The Comittee rely strongly on the Exertions of Maryland and Virginia 
in laying up ^Magazines for future Supply as well as obtaining present 
Relief. They have the most flattering Ideas of receiving that Assistance 
from those of which they have been unhappily dissappointed from other 
States, and must depend on them for their principal Supply. 
I have the Honour to be with great Respect 

Your very obedt Servt
